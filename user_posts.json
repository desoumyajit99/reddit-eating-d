I‚Äôve known for months- but.. it stings for me. So I still always refer to myself as bulimic anyways (is that offensive now by the way..? Like since I know I‚Äôm not an actual bulimic anymore..?). It just hurts my feelings in a weird way.. I just feel like when somebody hears ‚Äúanorexic‚Äù they automatically assume skinny- but I‚Äôm not yet. I do still purge like a bulimic.. I just don‚Äôt binge anymore.. and I have lost a lot of weight, but because of my starting weight this time I‚Äôm still not underweight which is a requirement to be a ‚Äútypical anorexic.‚Äù \n\nI‚Äôve heard other people also discuss their qualms with being considered an atypical anorexic but I‚Äôm not sure how many other people will deliberately still claim their past ED out of rejection of the new technical diagnosis.. for me it‚Äôs twofold because it is partially the fact that being called an ‚Äúatypical anorexic with purging tendencies‚Äù makes me feel super invalid compared to bulimia and also the fact that bulimia has been a large part of my life ED wise. I‚Äôm not usually a ‚Äúlabels‚Äù type of person when it comes to most things but because I‚Äôve struggled with it for so long bulimia feels like a part of my identity and it makes me feel weird to have that stripped from me- especially since I do still purge which I know most people associate with bulimia.. \n\n\n\n",

I‚Äôve reached a point in my relapse where I don‚Äôt even hide it anymore.

Why are you then trying to take away something I did feel comfortable eating? \n\nI‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a terrible attempt at trying to make me break out of my safe foods but it just doesn‚Äôt work. It feels counterintuitive, it upsets me, makes me feel like I‚Äôve failed and then I feel I have to rectify it by fasting/purging/both. I don‚Äôt even feel like my response of shame is abnormal for a person with an ED. I understand that a lot of people may not understand EDs in depth but come on. I feel like at the bare minimum that specifically shouldn‚Äôt have to be explained. It just really upsets me. \n\nUsually I just cry later and try to fix it.

When in reality I probably did exactly the opposite of what they wanted me to do in the end and they might have permanently made me lose a food I felt comfortable eating. I don‚Äôt know. I guess I‚Äôm just sensitive about my ED but it hurts my feelings and it honestly just feels to me as if it should be basic knowledge. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve noticed has happened with multiple people in my life and I just don‚Äôt get it. I know it‚Äôs not the case but sometimes it feels like they WANT me to get worse. Because to me it seems like my response is what‚Äôs to be expected of somebody with my feelings towards food which I‚Äôm very open about\n\nAlso it‚Äôs not like I ASK for their opinion on it- I feel like people just don‚Äôt take my ED seriously this time because I‚Äôm not uw yet.. and then when I finally do get there again then all of a sudden things will change but I‚Äôm so over it.. I just feel like people either don‚Äôt think about what they‚Äôre saying to me clearly because again- I feel like I have a pretty common response to those comments- or they do and they just don‚Äôt care.. but to me it seems like one or the other has to be true.. maybe I‚Äôm wrong I suppose but that‚Äôs just how I feel..",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôm so angry at myself. I‚Äôm confused about why I let it get this bad.\n\nSome background: I have several serious medical issues that existed before my eating disorder got out of control. Two of the biggest are CVID (common variable immune deficiency ‚Äî meaning I‚Äôm immunocompromised but not contagious or anything) and UCTD (undifferentiated connective tissue disease ‚Äî basically early autoimmune disease that hasn‚Äôt fully declared itself yet). With UCTD, many people never even progress into full autoimmune conditions if they take care of themselves and manage stress. But I didn‚Äôt.\n\nInstead, I relapsed.\n\nAnd not just any relapse ‚Äî this has been the worst relapse of my life, starting back in September. During it, I refused to see doctors (except for one ear issue and the dentist), and I completely stopped all my medications. I told people I wanted to try ‚Äúnatural healing,‚Äù but that was a lie. I was terrified the medications would make me gain weight ‚Äî even though they didn‚Äôt have that side effect.\n\nWell, now I don‚Äôt have UCTD anymore. It‚Äôs officially progressed into full-blown lupus (SLE). My rheumatologist also suspects I may have developed other autoimmune conditions, so I need more tests. Because, you know, my body just loves to keep it interesting. She told me to see an immunologist again and that‚Äôs coming up in a few days. After that, I‚Äôll do the rest of my testing all at once.\n\nAnd I‚Äôm terrified of what they‚Äôll find.\n\nMy gastroenterologist also says I need an endoscopy. I‚Äôve put it off for a very long time. I‚Äôm scared to see what bulimia has done to my esophagus ‚Äî especially since I have a dysfunctional immune system. And now, I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôll need my appendix removed soon (not an emergency, but another thing on the list). I actually should‚Äôve already done it- but I‚Äôm not back in my hometown yet which is where I want to get it done. I was supposed to be back already but I canceled my flight last minute. \n\nI‚Äôm overwhelmed.\n\nWhat really breaks me is knowing this didn‚Äôt have to happen. I‚Äôve seen other people with the same health issues fight so hard for treatment ‚Äî they‚Äôd do anything to get access to meds like SCIg. I got approved for it in two weeks. Even when I switched insurance companies. But I quit treatment after the first few doses because I mentally couldn‚Äôt handle it. I went to a support group for other people\nlike me.. because I thought it‚Äôd make me feel better. But it didn‚Äôt. I was the youngest there and I seemed so much healthier, I felt like I didn‚Äôt belong. They told me I‚Äôd need to switch to taking my injections to every other day instead of weekly and I just‚Ä¶ refused. I hated that the stupid needles had to stay in me for hours. \n\nI feel like an idiot. A reckless idiot.\n\nNow I‚Äôm looking at real damage. I‚Äôm terrified. I have an autoimmune disease known for attacking organs‚Äîpossibly multiple autoimmune diseases now. I‚Äôm immunocompromised and I‚Äôve been hard relapsing from my ED for months while completely off my meds. I don‚Äôt foresee I‚Äôm going to find out good things about my organs\n\nThe worst part? It STILL didn‚Äôt wake me up.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt snap me into recovery mode. It made me spiral deeper. My brain went, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm screwed anyways. Might as well be skinny.‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt want advice. I think I just wanted to vent somewhere. I‚Äôve been pretending I‚Äôm okay for so long. I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm angry. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm grieving the body I sabotaged. I don‚Äôt know how I allowed myself to do this to me\n\nAnd I still don‚Äôt know if I have it in me to stop",

      "selftext": "I want to be very clear I am very pro-recovery though I am not recovered or ready for it any time soon. However- for me, one of the scariest part is actually giving up the ED community. Being in ED spaces feels cozy for me in a weird way- I don‚Äôt feel judged and things of that nature for the most part. I feel like if I ever do recover and leave ED communities I‚Äôm going to spiral anyways because I start feeling isolated and alone. I know that because it‚Äôs what happens every time I try to recover.. I know a lot of the advice is going to be to try to make new friends and things of that nature, to help with the isolation aspect but the thing is that I‚Äôve tried a lot- many times- and it doesn‚Äôt really seem to go well for me which just makes me crash even harder into a relapse. I just don‚Äôt know what to do when it‚Äôs time to recover if I ever do feel ready for it.. it honestly makes me want to cry when I even think about leaving ED communities because I know how alone I‚Äôll feel. I know it‚Äôs sick obviously and again I am super pro-recovery but my ED and ED spaces is what comforts me.. without it mentally it makes me fall apart and I just relapse anyways. \n\nThe only real reason I‚Äôve ever managed to recover in the past and was able to stay recovered was because of being in a romantic relationship, I felt obligated to recover so I did and having a romantic partner made me feel like I wouldn‚Äôt be alone. But, that‚Äôs not really the reason I‚Äôm ‚Äúsupposed to‚Äù recover, also I‚Äôm single now and am refusing romantic relationships because I‚Äôve now realized if anything goes wrong in one, it causes me to crash very hard into a relapse. I don‚Äôt feel safe being in one anymore because I genuinely fear of what it could do to me. A break up is what caused my current relapse and I truly am starting to doubt my ability to recover at this point so ever getting into a romantic relationship again feels dangerous to me. I don‚Äôt know, it probably sounds overdramatic but this is the worst relapse of my life and I‚Äôve had an ED for over a decade at this point. I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to recover or even truly want recovery for me and to not feel so isolated\n\nAlso I apologize since this post may jump around a lot I‚Äôm just feeling lots of negative emotions at the moment so it made it harder for me to translate my thoughts coherently ",

      "title": "Extreme pain when I eat",
      "selftext": "I‚Äôm not looking for medical advice ‚Äî I‚Äôd just like to hear people‚Äôs personal experiences with this, please.\n\nI recently saw a gastroenterologist who said I‚Äôll need to have my appendix removed soon (not emergent, but necessary). I also found out I have an umbilical hernia, which I suspect is from purging. I‚Äôve had gastroparesis for years, and I‚Äôve struggled with bulimia off and on since I was 13 (I‚Äôm 25 now). Just wanted to share that background since it might be relevant.\n\nNow to the actual issue:\nEating is excruciating. It‚Äôs been painful for months, but it‚Äôs getting worse. I just spent the last 12 hours crying off and on because I ate something ‚Äî not even a normal portion ‚Äî and it wrecked me. It was the only thing I ate all day. Liquids are usually better, but not always. Even tiny amounts can hurt. I‚Äôm not trying to recover right now ‚Äî I‚Äôm not ready ‚Äî but I know I still need to eat something during a relapse, and I can‚Äôt even do that without pain. I have to >!purge!< to make the pain stop.\n\nI asked my GI and he said the pain could be permanent, but that I could take painkillers to manage it. That‚Äôs terrifying. I don‚Äôt want to need medication just to eat for the rest of my life.  I am going to get another opinion because maybe I‚Äôm just in denial but I‚Äôm struggling to accept that. Regardless, this is honestly pushing me deeper into the relapse because I keep thinking: if I‚Äôm already ruined, what‚Äôs the point?\n\nIf you‚Äôve experienced this- did it get better?\nI used to ‚Äúbounce back‚Äù after restriction if I slowly worked my way up ‚Äî liquids to soft food to solid. But I can‚Äôt even do soft food now. It hurts so much. And that‚Äôs making me afraid that I‚Äôve done permanent damage.\n\nI think this is partly because my restriction this time has been so intense. I‚Äôve had failed ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù attempts since my relapse started in September, but even when I was ‚Äútrying,‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt hit >!700!< cal most of the time both because of my ED thoughts but also the physical pain. Most days I was stuck at >!300‚Äì500!< max, and honestly I think I burned off a lot of muscle rather than fat. This is the most extreme restriction I‚Äôve ever sustained, and I think my body is just breaking down. Usually my cals from relapses are much higher and I have lots of binges but this time wasn‚Äôt like that\n\nHas anyone else had unbearable pain when trying to eat, even in small amounts? Is this common with long-term restriction? Is it normal or am I being dramatic? I feel lost. I feel like such a whiner because I didn‚Äôt even end up in the hospital or something so I feel like maybe I‚Äôm just being a wuss and I need to toughen up..I‚Äôm not even skinny this is so frustrating for me. I know that‚Äôs not supposed to matter to me but I mean if I‚Äôm going to be like this.. like at least make me skinny üò≠",

      "selftext": "(Sorry for the unstructured writing) Hello everyone, two days ago my (13) disabled brother was walking home from school when he was hit by a moving car I won't get too much into it because the cops are still investigating but it was a hit and run and my brother ended up with numerous injuries including brain damage and he has been unconscious in the hospital ever since. I am still in denial if you couldn't tell, I have been feeling feelings like I've never felt before, I've been depressed my whole life but this feels different like my whole life has been turned upside down and my life and my parents life will never be the same, as you can imagine we have been getting lots of messages and calls from friends and family wanting to know what happened and we don't have any energy to deal with nosy family members.\n\nWhen I briefly went home yesterday to get some items like a charger my headphones and some books I decided that I was going to call my best friend and tell her what happened (mind you the only people that we've really talked to were just my grandparents) when she first picks up she sounds very upbeat and she says \"so how's the dead brother\" we've always had a sarcastic dark humor friendship about a lot of stuff but this was just so shocking and I kind of pause before asking her not to make fun of the situation because I don't know if he's going to live or die and she kind of backs off and starts apologizing and saying she didn't mean it and after that we had a pretty good conversation.\n\nFast forward today I get a call from her sister saying how she heard her sister (my best friend) saying some \"pretty fucked up shit\" about my brother to her family, she was saying how \"getting hit by a car in 2025 is crazy\" and \"I can't believe that (my name) was actuallly sad about it\" as if he isn't my fucking brother. Anyway she was basically just saying stuff like that and being a bitch, which genuinely shocked me to my core because I had confided in her for years about everything that I've had to go through and she's never done anything like this.\n\nI didn't want to believe it so I called my best friend directly and confronted her and I was met with silence literal silence and then when she sighed and I heard her begin to apologize, I hanged up and turned off my phone and I'm indecisive about what to do. I don't want her apologizes or her fake empathy and I certainly don't want to be friends with someone who doesn't even have the decency to not gossip about a child that's in the hospital. But she's also still my best friend and we've been through so much.\n\nThe only person I have been in contact with is my grandma and when I told her what happened she told me that my emotions are high right now and that I shouldn't do anything hasty, our families are close and so apparently a lot of my cousins are siding with her and saying that I overreacted and I'm doing too much.\n\nPlease give me some advice on what to do. Thank you",

I know the show is not meant to be centered around romance but I mean come on if your going to have it even as a sub genre I would hope the actors are somewhat romantically compatible. The only time I ever saw any affection was on the boat in s1 but otherwise nothing. I felt Rose did love Peter but it felt circumstantial and she was just so shitty in s2. I was quite literally shipping them with everyone else, I mean Peter had more chemistry with Noor and Alice then Rose atp and I think their relationship should‚Äôve ended in s1. I watched interviews of Gabe and Luciane and the actors seem to have some chemistry but it just didn't translate on screen for some reason.\n\n",

After buying food I would run home to devour. \nHad a rock bottom binging on pastries squatting on a forest trashy road (couldn‚Äôt at home because there was family). A man came by and I didn‚Äôt even stop. \n\nHow I got better is I went to another country to meet my bf family. Been there over a month and getting away from my family and environment been amazing. Still tough but doable. \n\nI want to continue with my streak. I‚Äôm very proud of it. \n\nNothing gives me more feelings of power than being able to be surrounded by sweets and pastries and junk food and not being even tempted most of the time ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",

      "selftext": "This goddamn illness is getting worse to the point my \"stealth\" approach doesn't seem to be working anymore. My therapist is saying I've become \"worryingly thin\" and is gently suggesting I seek inpatient treatment (for a multitude of things, but rex is definitely one of them), and even my friends are starting to suspect something is up with me (I make a point to eat in front of them too so as to shut down any concerns about my weight). I've hit nearly all the metrics and measurements I set, but I'm still not satisfied. This ain't my first time at the rodeo and I'm almost 22 years old so I'm pretty self aware about my disorder at this point. I finally figured out though why I'm still miserable when I look at my body - it's because I have no tits.\n\nNow here's the crazy thing: I don't care about having big boobs. I don't want to have big boobs. I've never had big boobs. And I've always loved having small boobs. But now I'm at the point where I'm completely flat chested, and with my height and broad shoulders, I could easily pass as a man (which off topic, is a plus for all the gender shit I'm trying to confront lmao). Of course, my bras are heavily padded, but it's how I look when I take it off that fills me with so much self-hatred and exhaustion after suffering for so long.\n\nFrom when I was a kid, I always knew that I would be \"truly thin\" if my breasts stuck out further than my stomach. That was what my mom beat into my head as early as I could understand the concept of beauty. My tits and my stomach are in line with each other, which for my flawed logic means I'm \"pudgy\". There's also a weird, creepy part of me that's saying I shouldn't even be writing this right now because \"only ***real*** skinny people should be venting on this sub; and because your boobs aren't further out than your stomach, you're not thin at all, you're averagespo\" even though that's just late stage decade-long rex just being a fucking dick, as usual.\n\nCan anyone else relate? Do weird/unconventional proportions skew how anyone else's view of their bodies too?",

      "title": "Diagnosed at 18, almost 22 now; parentified and highly traumatized, realizing I might actually be medium support needs instead but don‚Äôt know how to handle it",
      "selftext": "So for context, I (21 F) got diagnosed 3 years ago and have been living with very minimal support since then. I had burnout and skills regression for a couple months after my diagnosis, but I couldn‚Äôt take time to understand and process for any longer because I had to jump right back into my shit life I was living at the time. (For context, I‚Äôm a highly traumatized person who has also been parentified. I‚Äôve faced sexual abuse; physical, psychological, financial, and emotional abuse from my family; I had to take care of my delinquent little sister that dropped out of high school, while my homeless dad did drugs and my mom was out stalking who would become my future step dad. I wish I was making this shit up and I can‚Äôt believe I was ever in that bad of a spot, looking back now that I‚Äôve moved out recently.)\n\nBut anyway, I went back to college last year and for the first time in my life I got academic supports. Extra time on tests, assistance filling out forms, option to take testing in another room, but that‚Äôs it. I didn‚Äôt feel like it was sufficient enough because my grades stayed stagnant, but I just figured I was being ungrateful and I should be glad I was getting supports in the first place. (From a lifetime of hyper independence and no one acknowledging I might have a disability, I felt pressured to ‚Äútake what I can get‚Äù, not thinking there was anything else out there for me or my input about my care mattered.)\n\nI‚Äôve went through about 6 jobs since then, faced A LOT of ableism, and the few jobs that were supposedly willing to accommodate me never got around to it or, once again, gave me the bare minimum.\n\nI‚Äôm at a point in my life where I‚Äôm out of the abusive home I grew up in, I have space to actually relax and be myself, but I‚Äôm finding I quite literally, functionally, can‚Äôt live on my own. It makes a little bit of sense, because whether I was taking care of others or not, I still couldn‚Äôt do my iADLs for myself.\n\nMasking now evokes a feeling of panic and unsafeness that is so severe that I‚Äôve never felt before. Perhaps it‚Äôs the trauma catching up to me, but whatever the case may be, I literally can‚Äôt live how I used to anymore.\n\nI need a direct support professional to help prompt me with daily tasks and accompany me certain places in public where I have high anxiety. I need noise cancelling headphones and sunglasses to deal with the sensory bullshit of everyday life. I need an AAC device because talking makes me feel like I‚Äôm going to vomit most times and I can‚Äôt even communicate effectively because my spoken communication vs my written communication are so drastically different.\n\nI‚Äôm so scared of asking for help because I‚Äôve already established myself as this ‚Äútough autistic bitch that can handle anything‚Äù, but I‚Äôm starting to realize that‚Äôs just survivorship bias that was placed upon me because no one wants to accommodate a supposedly ‚Äúnormal looking‚Äù autistic woman.\n\nI‚Äôm also kind of scared of the autistic community as of late. I don‚Äôt know, things seem to have gotten so much more mean and judgey, across people from all levels of support. I feel like I‚Äôm actually medium support needs instead of low support needs, but the feeling I get both IRL and looking across various autistic subreddits is that I‚Äôll be ‚Äúa fake‚Äù if I ask for higher supports now, when I should‚Äôve known I needed more help in the first place.\n\nIdk, maybe I‚Äôm just getting in my own head about all of this. Do you guys think I‚Äôm asking for too much? Is it normal/okay to realize you need more support as you settle in to your diagnosis?",

      "selftext": "I'm undergoing a major life change right now (leaving an abusive home) and I'm finally giving myself permission to eat to fullness again, but I feel like I just switched around *how* I restrict and tbh it's giving me worse health problems and interrupting my life more than AN-R and AN-BP did. I sincerely think that orthorexia should be classified as a subcategory of anorexia the next time a DSM is published, because even though I'm physically eating more now, it's really just volume eating with nothing but raw fruits and veggies - same restrictive caloric intake as before more or less. This fucking sucks because I'm so goddamn constipated to the point it feels like I'm 9 months pregnant with a poop baby that will not. fucking. **move**. \n\nI'm so fucking scared of dairy and protein and I am *verrrrryyyy* picky about what carbs enter my body. I'm studying for 2 healthcare degrees right now so I'm constantly around talk of interactions between food and different body systems, and my delusional ass likes to blow these facts way out proportion and use them as justification to restrict.\n\nI just don't get it. I'm in a new place. I'm safe now. I thought I would be able to stop but there's a sick part of me that doesn't want to let go. I'm even lonelier than before and it never really clicked until recently how people can feel like eating disorders are actual little friends. \n\nI fucked up my body so bad with laxatives over the past 8 years, I'm afraid I became dependent now. I bought some kefir yesterday and I'm making it a morning ritual to drink a glass because maybe there's an imbalance of bacteria in my gut causing constipation? It feels like nothing is moving though. I also for some stupid goddamn reason cut out all caffeine, which in theory should be good bc I was WAY over the daily recommended intake, but without coffee, there's actually nothing happening.\n\nYeah, idk, just screaming into the void.",

I feel like if Stuart was still with the band at that point, he would've added his signature syncopation and fuzz pedal, making it sound a lot more like something off of ROTSC.\n\nWhich got me thinking, what are some later Jamiroquai songs you wish you could hear Stuart's version of? Would you think Stuart's playing style would enhance them / make them better than the original?\n\nFor me, I would love to hear Stu's take on Little L, Canned Heat, Time Won't Wait, She's A Fast Persuader, and pretty much anything off of Automaton. (That album has such distinct and precise Paul Turner bass lines‚Ñ¢, and Stuart has a much more warm, bouncy, and funky tone, so I'd be curious as to how that'd sound. I imagine the songs would have to be slowed down a little bit lol)",

      "selftext": "So I'm in college and this will be the first time I'm able to vote in the gubernatorial election. I voted for Harris this past presidential election, and after doing my research on the candidates and what they're *currently doing* for their communities, I know I'm voting for Ras Baraka.\n\nI want to get more involved this time though, and ever since the 2024 election I've been focused on community organization and the importance of grassroots efforts. I was thinking of volunteering with social media or field and voter engagement, maybe even being part of fundraising or event planning, and I was wondering if anyone else has had any experience with that and could tell me what it's like? \n\nAlso, I'm aware that the date for the primary has been moved to June 10th, but I've never voted in a primary before and I don't know how they work for governor's elections. If I registered to vote last year, do I have to register again? Will there be a nominee for each party (Dem + Rep) like in a general election? Do candidates for governor hold town halls or debates? If so, will they be televised?\n\nSorry if I sound a little clueless, I'm still new to this whole getting-off-my-ass-and-actually-doing-something thing ever since I largely quit the internet and vapid neolib online activism. Any advice, suggestions, and help would be greatly appreciated. üôè",

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.\n\n(Also, I‚Äôm not too concerned with how it looks and we don‚Äôt plan on putting any carpet down there because in the past the basement has been prone to flooding, so it would just be a waste.

My eyes wander now to the body glitter trailing its way down from your blush in streaks of post-dance-break sweat. *‚ÄùNo. I prefer quieter nights than this. I always say I‚Äôm better one on one‚Äù*.  I find myself chuckling again but my fingers tense reflexively around my glass as you pull away and sit up. My voice catches in my throat for fear of having upset you, *‚ÄùBut this place is great!

I can feel every shift in my own slumped posture as your eyes scan every inch of me. My over-washed hair sticks damp to my neck; my small chest rises and falls under the thin material of these tacky hen do group shirts; my whole figure feels boxy and tight and baggy all at once as I try to hold myself back from fixing my appearance under the sudden pressure. My skin burns under your gaze before you let your lips smack and say-\n\n*‚ÄùI was told you were the bold one. You really don‚Äôt like crowds, do you?‚Äù*. Each perfect syllable from you has me giggling like a madwoman. I have been single for too long. Or drinking too much.

I nervously flick my hair from my neck and let it fan out over my paler skin in the hope that it makes my blush less obvious. I bite the inside of my cheek, hard. Something about the glint in your eye makes me feel like I‚Äôve already lost a game I didn‚Äôt realise I was playing. I clear my throat, lean in just enough to pretend it's about the music and say, far too loudly,\n\n*\"Well, I mean, if we were one-on-one, I‚Äôd be way more charming. You‚Äôd probably be, um, really impressed.\"*\n\nA beat. A blink. A laugh. Yours, then mine. You weren‚Äôt being unkind, I knew that- know that- but I still can‚Äôt help the small squeaks escaping me at your dark chuckling. The vinyl beneath me squeaks and squelches, too, as I melt away from you and into the booth. *‚ÄùSo forward but still so shy! You really are an enigma‚Ä¶ an adorable little enigma‚Äù*\n\nI watch from my corner of the booth as you reach thoughtlessly for my glass. I do absolutely nothing as you raise it to your glossy, glittery lips and take the last few mouthfuls into your throat effortlessly. You gulp, I gulp. You slide the glass back over to me and I fold forward to it. You knew it was my glass. You watch as my hands wrap around it like an altar and wipe our lipsticks off the rim and onto my skin‚Ä¶\n\nIn an instant, we both understand each other‚Äôs desires, and both slide to meet in the middle of this squeaky little booth. Your right hand finds my thigh- my hand finds yours. Your left thumb traces the edge of my smeared lipstick- my lips part with a gasp before eagerly testing your skin with my tongue. Your eyes scream for me to continue but your face tells me to take this somewhere more comfortable. I go to turn your hand so that I can rest my burning face into your palm, but hear the now familiar sound of vinyl squeaking.\n\n**\"HEeyyyyyy~ We need to goooo cos the bar‚Äôs closinnn‚Ä¶‚Äù** half screamed into my ear as the rest of our party collapse into the 4-person booth with us. **‚ÄùYou twoo are des-designated drivers, righhtt??‚Äù**\n\nAnd just like that, we both drove home alone (each chaperoning 4 more drunk women).\n",

As you may also know, we've had new restrictions placed on us so that (even though I'm obviously an adult and even though I tried uploading 2 sets of my actual ID) we can't access nsfw content without extreme proof of our age. \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to explain where I've been. I have a day off tomorrow but still haven't got access on my laptop yet so it'll likely be a shorter one if I do write. Feel free to leave suggestions, I still don't know how reddit will cope with the setup but I suppose we'll all find out together.. \n\nLots of love~",

      "title": "Petrichor - Full Version",
      "selftext": "Petrichor - First posted in my subreddit r/Ms_Rs_Erotica \n\nThe summer heat beats down against the dirt path under us. It hadn't rained in weeks, and the earth was cracking before us and resealing behind us, fused shut by our gallons of sweat. You're walking a bit in front of me, but slightly lagging as you try and fail to unstick your feet from your sweat-soaked sandals. As much as I hate to see you struggling, I am certainly enjoying the view...\n\nYour tank top‚Äôs clinging to the curve of your back, damp and dark with sweat along the spine. The hair is sticking to your neck, your long straight locks now loose and frizzy, the crown of your head glinting gold under the sun. Every so often you try to push it off of your face, but your movements are growing sluggish. Just as your steps begin to veer off to one side, I run up behind you to walk at your side.\n\n*\"Arms up.\"* I command bluntly, my hand already wrapped along your other shoulder to prevent your imminent collapse. You don't protest, just slowly grunt in dazed confusion as you sling your hand over my neck. In a single smooth motion, I have you laying back against my chest- your knees resting on one arm as you hang from me.\n\nYou gasp with every step, the slight jolt making your whole body shudder in my arms. Sweat beads and builds up along your jaw until I press my lips there, kissing your discomfort away and stomaching the salty mix on your behalf. You smell like sunscreen, like heat, like womanhood- that soft, salty scent rising stronger the linger we're out here. You‚Äôre flushed deep at the chest, collarbones glistening, breath short and whimper-light. Every movement‚Äôs smaller than it should be. You don‚Äôt say it, but I can see it in the way you look up at me. The way your bottom lip‚Äôs pulled tight between your teeth.\n\n*\"Kiss me? Please, Mommy?\"* you whisper against my chest, your eyes searching my face for signs of my own faltering. The heat builds around us- between us- and I feel all the hairs of my body stir. Your mouth is right there. So delicate, so eager, so beautiful there pinned between your teeth. I lean in, forehead resting against yours for a breath before I take your lips with mine, slow and deep and utterly tender.\n\nWe both forget ourselves on this back road. Lose the world, the heat, the horrible feeling of sweat between our bodies, and find ourselves instead. You, me, two mouths, two bodies, right here. Together. Just as I pull away from what could have been hours of kissing, we've made it home. Finally, sweet, well ventilated shade!\n\nI sit you on the soft, cool tile of the garden wall- your sweaty thighs making a disgusting yet sensual *shlup* against the ceramic- and turn to unlock the door. The crisp air of home is overwhelming after such a long walk in the sun, but you're still outside. Your eyes confirm what I'm slowly beginning to consider... What would be the point of going in, when no-one can see us here?\n\n*\"Have you drunk enough, my love?\"* I'm not quite asking as I hand you my bottle. *\"You've lost a lot of fluids. And that‚Äôs only going to get worse...\"* I tease, tugging my long shorts down and inch to cover my knees as I sink to the shockingly cold tile. \n\n*\"I've drunk... promise... but I'll be a good girl\"* you rasp, your voice barely above a whisper with the dehydration. Forgetting yourself completely, you let a few drips escape the chilled bottle and turn your teasing outfit even more revealing. You snap the translucent tank top against your skin and watch me gulp from the floor. You slowly spread your legs and giggle as I gasp, each moment a prolonged tease for both of us as we hold back.\n\n*\"I love you, dirty girl... but are you sure this is what you want? That you've drunk enough- and- and that you're not scared of getting caught??\"* \n\nThat smirk is the only answer I'm going to get as you hand me back my bottle. I tip the bottle back, letting the chilling fluid gush past my lips, over my tongue, and down my throat in one effortless stream. I close my eyes and fully indulge in the moment.. It's not enough. \n\nI reopen my eyes to find your shorts around your ankles, and your panties aside. Your eyes command me to dive into the oasis between your legs, but I wait for consent first. I'm a good domme. I'm a good girl.\n\n*\"Come get it, Mommy~ I know you want to drink up\"* you tease, your voice still a raspy, needy mess.\n\nI press my face to your dripping heat, forgetting all the discomfort that heat has brought me today. I rest my chin on the lip of the tile- the altar- and shove my face in. My nose works your already swollen clit as my tongue splits you open and dips into you at last. I'm messy, inelegant- desperate- but I don‚Äôt care. Your juices drip down my chin and soak my shirt even more than the sweat has. This heat has made recrystallised my need. Gone are the frills, the filler, the commands, the dominance! I am weak and thirsty and obedient and you are.. everything. My throat works harder and harder around each swallow, chest heaving, jaw slack, and when I finally pull away, breathless and wet-lipped, I catch you watching me like I‚Äôve just bared something obscene.\n\n*\"Please, don't look at me like that... I could still be in charge,\"* I moan, thumbing your clit messily as I try to hold myself back from diving in against, *\"I can be.. I just... fuck I need this right now\"*. Your hand in my hair reassures me more than words could, and the not so soft tug towards your now throbbing cunt helps too.\n\nThere's too much. Too much sweat, too much pleasure, too much heat. I go to speak and you tug me back in. You go to speak and it comes out as louder and loader moans, your voice mounting and mounting. Your nails dig into my sore (possibly sunburnt) scalp as you fully regain your voice. Cracking, raw, and rasping, you cry out and clasp your thighs around my head so I can barely hear you- before collapsing forward against me.\n\nIn the afterglow- still bare, still trembling, still slack around my head like the worlds laziest koala- I finally notice the scent properly. Sweat and dust. Summer heat and your slick. That last spill of water drying on your belly, the flood of your juices drying onto me. The air is thick with it, like the earth right after the first rain. Alive.\n\n‚ÄúPetrichor,‚Äù I murmur, not even meaning to say it aloud. You hum softly as I rise for one more kiss- slow, salty, sweet, final.",

You don‚Äôt say it, but I can see it in the way you look up at me. The way your bottom lip‚Äôs pulled tight between your teeth.\n\n*\"Kiss me? Please, Mommy?\"* you whisper against my chest, your eyes searching my face for signs of my own faltering. The heat builds around us- between us- and I feel all the hairs of my body stir. Your mouth is right there. So delicate, so eager, so beautiful there pinned between your teeth. I lean in, forehead resting against yours for a breath before I take your lips with mine, slow and deep and utterly tender.\n\nWe both forget ourselves on this back road. Lose the world, the heat, the horrible feeling of sweat between our bodies, and find ourselves instead. You, me, two mouths, two bodies, right here. Together. Just as I pull away from what could have been hours of kissing, we've made it home. Finally, sweet, well ventilated shade!\n\nI sit you on the soft, cool tile of the garden wall- your sweaty thighs making a disgusting yet sensual *shlup* against the ceramic- and turn to unlock the door. The crisp air of home is overwhelming after such a long walk in the sun, but you're still outside. Your eyes confirm what I'm slowly beginning to consider... What would be the point of going in, when no-one can see us here?\n\n*\"Have you drunk enough, my love?\"* I'm not quite asking as I hand you my bottle. *\"You've lost a lot of fluids. And that‚Äôs only going to get worse...\"* I tease, tugging my long shorts down and inch to cover my knees as I sink to the shockingly cold tile. \n\n*\"I've drunk... promise... but I'll be a good girl\"* you rasp, your voice barely above a whisper with the dehydration. Forgetting yourself completely, you let a few drips escape the chilled bottle and turn your teasing outfit even more revealing. You snap the translucent tank top against your skin and watch me gulp from the floor. You slowly spread your legs and giggle as I gasp, each moment a prolonged tease for both of us as we hold back.\n\n*\"I love you, dirty girl... but are you sure this is what you want? That you've drunk enough- and- and that you're not scared of getting caught??\"* \n\nThat smirk is the only answer I'm going to get as you hand me back my bottle. I tip the bottle back, letting the chilling fluid gush past my lips, over my tongue, and down my throat in one effortless stream. I close my eyes and fully indulge in the moment.. It's not enough. \n\nI reopen my eyes to find your shorts around your ankles, and your panties aside. Your eyes command me to dive into the oasis between your legs, but I wait for consent first. I'm a good domme. I'm a good girl.\n\n*\"Come get it, Mommy~ I know you want to drink up\"* you tease, your voice still a raspy, needy mess.\n\nI press my face to your dripping heat, forgetting all the discomfort that heat has brought me today. I rest my chin on the lip of the tile- the altar- and shove my face in. My nose works your already swollen clit as my tongue splits you open and dips into you at last. I'm messy, inelegant- desperate- but I don‚Äôt care. Your juices drip down my chin and soak my shirt even more than the sweat has. This heat has made recrystallised my need. Gone are the frills, the filler, the commands, the dominance! I am weak and thirsty and obedient and you are.. everything. My throat works harder and harder around each swallow, chest heaving, jaw slack, and when I finally pull away, breathless and wet-lipped, I catch you watching me like I‚Äôve just bared something obscene.\n\n*\"Please, don't look at me like that... I could still be in charge,\"* I moan, thumbing your clit messily as I try to hold myself back from diving in against, *\"I can be.. I just... fuck I need this right now\"*. Your hand in my hair reassures me more than words could, and the not so soft tug towards your now throbbing cunt helps too.\n\nThere's too much. Too much sweat, too much pleasure, too much heat. I go to speak and you tug me back in. You go to speak and it comes out as louder and loader moans, your voice mounting and mounting. Your nails dig into my sore (possibly sunburnt) scalp as you fully regain your voice. Cracking, raw, and rasping, you cry out and clasp your thighs around my head so I can barely hear you- before collapsing forward against me.\n\nIn the afterglow- still bare, still trembling, still slack around my head like the worlds laziest koala- I finally notice the scent properly. Sweat and dust. Summer heat and your slick. That last spill of water drying on your belly, the flood of your juices drying onto me. The air is thick with it, like the earth right after the first rain. Alive.\n\n‚ÄúPetrichor,‚Äù I murmur, not even meaning to say it aloud. You hum softly as I rise for one more kiss- slow, salty, sweet, final.",

I‚Äôve been doing this for a while now, and I‚Äôve recently refined my rates to better reflect the time and care I put into every word.\n\nRates:\n\n‚Ç¨0.04/word minimum for custom prose (most commissions are ~1,000 words or more, usually ‚Ç¨40+ depending on complexity).\n\n‚Ç¨25/hour minimum for erotic RP (done via Reddit or Discord).\n\n\nUnlike my public pieces‚Äîwhich are trimmed to fit sub rules and audience limits‚Äîmy commissioned work is longer, rawer, more emotionally intense, more personalised. More yours. More mine. I‚Äôm not here to just write a dirty paragraph‚ÄîI‚Äôm here to build a full fantasy tailored to you.\n\nIf you‚Äôve got an idea, a kink, or a single perfect phrase echoing in your head‚ÄîI‚Äôll run with it. I don‚Äôt shy away from the dark or twisted, and I don‚Äôt hold back once the gloves come off. The only limits are legal ones.\n\nIf RP is more your speed, I‚Äôve got years of experience and a dominant hand. My inbox is open for those who know what they‚Äôre craving.\n\nWant something that feels like it was written just for you? Want to feel owned by a voice that knows how to get inside your head? Want your inbox to hurt when I leave it unread?\n\nYou know what to do. Payment details are in my bio.\nMake me want to write for you.",

      "selftext": "You don't get in until after 3 am. I don't arrive until the late morning. You're still asleep, lying on your front with one leg raised and one hand clutching needily at the cold empty pillow where I'll be sleeping for the next half-week.\n\nI'm as quiet as possible so that I don't wake you. The soft mumbles at the incredible sight threaten to ruin my progress, but I keep it to soft growls-\n\n\"My pretty baby.. My angel.. my good girl. Truly the fairest of them all\"\n\nI slide your hand out of my way before delicately crawling into bed and replacing it on my cheek. You're so beautiful right now‚Äî your eyes hiding away in the pillow to avoid the harsh morning sun through the gap in the curtains; your hair cascading all around your pillow, fanning out and advertising that you've arrived; your perfect lips just very slightly parted...\n\nI place what I think is a very gentle kiss to your sleeping lips and watch in horror as you instantly squirm to life.\n\n\"Woken with a kiss.. does that make this true love?\" I whisper, gently rubbing your cheek.\n\nYou don't react immediately, and I cringe uncontrollably at the realisation that it might sound like I'm saying I love you first and you were barely awake to hear it. I scan every centimetre of your face to tell if you got the reference, planning my careful backpedalling if you didn't, trying not to sound like I¬†*don't*¬†love you but-\n\n\"Mmmhmm.. my Prince...ess\" she warmly mutters, clinging to me and squirming closer slightly. I let my worrying melt away into soft cuddles and sloppy kisses, though our mouths are a little dry (I should find a good way to stop my mouth opening while I'm asleep, does taping actually work?)\n\nAgain. Instantly. A clingy hand on my belly stops my racing mind.\n\n\"Mmm morning babyy\\~ I've really missed you,\" squirming closer to my sleepy girl.\n\n\"Missed you moreee.. had no-one to give me what I need.\" She grunts, her raised leg curling around my waist now.\n\n\"That's not how you ask for what you want, Love\"\n\nShe squirms again, a semi defeated bratty whine as she does. How could I deny her when she looks this good? How could I deny her after so long apart?\n\nMy hand slides down to her outer thigh and she tenses under the soft touch. My fingers fan out, reaching and rubbing gently into the tight muscle. \"You look really good, honey.. but you know only good girls get to have fun\"\n\nI watch as she processes the information.. it's a slow process, partly from her lack of sleep, mostly from a reluctance to give in despite the pleasure that comes with it.\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nHer hand drops and mine jumps to her ass.\n\n\"Come here.. and ask nicely\"\n\n\"I need you.. and I've been a good girl while you're away..\" nuzzling sweetly as she tries to distract me from her current misbehaviour. I let her off for now. If nothing else, we'd wake up the whole hotel if I punished her now.\n\nI scoop her in by the ass and start kissing her. Her soft whimpers confirm what she's been saying all week on the phone, she really needs this. Kiss after sloppy kiss, gently biting at her lips just enough to wake her up, straight back to kisses as my other hand sneaks under her chest and round into her hair.\n\n\"So pretty, baby.. you've earned one round. Then we're getting you back to sleep\"\n\nShe whines and whispers in my ear\n\n\"I need you.. fully. Please.... Please, Mommy?\"\n\n\"There's my good girl. Remember to keep quiet for now though, ok?\"\n\nI grin stupidly, the dumb grin that you've given me almost every night since we met. I know you won't be able to, you know that I won't make you, and we both know everyone here is going to hate how perfectly we fit together.\n\nI lift you onto my hips before placing you on your back. You don't let go of my sides with your needy thighs and I groan lovingly. I can't reach any toys from here, but one look in your eyes lets me know that you know that already..\n\nWith a powerful kiss, I drop a hand from your hair all the way down to your shorts, letting it toy withe fabric as it checks... no panties. And from the view of how excited you are, no bra either.\n\n\"I love when you know I'm coming.. almost as much as I love this view\". The words come out as I primal muttering as I kiss the outline of your rock hard nipples through your baggy t shirt. \"You're gorgeous, darling.. why don't you get us both ready?\"\n\nA devilish grin excites you to tear off your clothes. You know how much I love seeing you strip, eager and needy being one of my favourite modes for you.\n\n\"Princess.. is there something you forgot?\"\n\nI gesture to my clothes. You hadn't even thought about it. I'm finally letting you undress me.\n\nYour hands come to my shoulders and delicately clutch at the fabric, your breath tight and fast at the honour of undressing me. \"Do it, Babe. I mean it\"\n\nIn an instant, my blouse is on the floor. Your hands fumble with my belt, the thick heavy buckle just too much for your sleepy grabby hands. You let out a whine so pathetic that I almost take you like this...\n\nI reach down and stroke the back of your hand as I curl one finger around the buckle and free myself in one smooth and simple motion. \"Keep going, Hun. That whine was really hot by the way.\"\n\nYou're blushing and your nipples harden even further in response. Your hands grow confident, tugging away at the tight denim around my bulge. You hadn't acknowledged it before. You see it now.\n\n\"Wore it all day for you. You had know idea how hard airport security was, but fuck did it feel good to imagine that face when you realised..\"\n\nYou whimper and drop your hands, on the verge of tears!? Part of me screams to stop and cuddle you, part of me says to crawl forward and let you bury your face in it. I go with option number 3, gently undoing the button on the front of my boxers and pulling myself free of the straining fabric.\n\nYou gasp softly before licking your lips. Before you even speak I've pressed the tip past your lips.\n\n\"We need it nice and wet, Beautiful. Can you get Mommy nice and sloppy?\"\n\nYou nod around the hard silicone, every motion of your head guiding you an inch deeper on the thick cock you're growing addicted to. I watch in awe as you squirm slightly, giving you the space to bend and press your lips to my bush.\n\n\"Fuck, baby.. you a good girl?\" I grunt, gripping your hair and holding you to my crotch as you kiss the soft skin. You try to nod but it just drives me deeper into your throat.\n\nMy hand slides to your cheek, rubbing softly as I cherish you. I pull my hand away and ask if you're ready for me. As you nod, my hand slaps you right on the cheek where I rubbed just a few seconds ago. You fall off my cock, your sloppy lips still connected to me through spit and lust- your eyes wild and alive with need.\n\n\"Don't ever think bratting goes unpunished.\" I grunt swiftly before pulling back, watching as your needy body aches for me. You're dripping onto the clean sheets. Dirty girl.\n\nMy hand slides to your throat as I growl-¬†*What are you. Who do you belong to. What do you need.*\n\n\"Dumb slut.. You, Mommy.. You Mommy!!\". Your eyes are trained on mine, scouring for any hint of compassion as I stare back at you with a wild hunger.\n\nWhile you're distracted looking up at me, my hands are still wandering. The one on your throat tightens. The other has found your dripping cunt and a sole finger curls, the first joint of an index finger dipping into you and sliding from bottom to top- the nail grazing your swollen clit. You shudder and I suck my finger clean.\n\n\"Want this cock?\"\n\n*Wild nodding*\n\n\"Thought so.\"\n\nMore on my subreddit¬†[r/Ms\\_Rs\\_Erotica](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ms_Rs_Erotica/)¬†but this is the one I'm proudest of.

      "selftext": "This was a commission I was told to share with all of you. I hope you enjoy it as much as the depraved little puppy it was written for did. The length is about the length of all commissions (this one hit nearly 3 pages) but the diary style is a first for me.\n\nKinks: Incest, Plap (referenced), Gooning/extreme porn use, Musk\n\n---\n\n30/06/25 - 11.06am\n\nDear diary\n\nWe‚Äôve been at Mum and Dad's for a day but I‚Äôm increasingly worried about June. Shutting herself up in her room all day and night, strange noises coming out at all times, those extra long bathroom trips when she leaves the room smelling funny after‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs in the laundry room now and all I can hear is sniffling and these big heaving breaths? I think I need to check on her.\n\n‚Äî\n\n30/06/25 - 11.31am\n\nDear diary\n\nSo I went to the door of the laundry room and poked my head in just to see if she was okay and her face was buried in the dirty laundry? Her shoulders were coming up and down in wracking sobs as she sniffled into them. \n\nWhen I drew closer, it struck me- it was only my laundry!\n\n‚ÄòHoly shit, June!?‚Äô I cried from right behind her, my small frame fencing her into the corner of the room with the almost empty hamper\n\n‚ÄòFU- Oh! Uhhh hi.. Mika.. I was just sniff testing the washing‚Ä¶ to.. Make sure we‚Äôre not wasting water in this heat.‚Äô My eyes bore up into hers with a palpable disgust as she got redder and redder. ‚ÄòAll smells good! I mean!! Ummm.. like it deserves washing! Not that you smell or-‚Äô\n\nI didn‚Äôt hear the rest as I ran back to write this. Wtaf has got into her!\n\n‚Äî\n\n\n\n01/07/25 - 00.52am\n\nDear diary,\n\nMore weird sounds tonight. She really needs to fix her sleep schedule. I can hear the music from her headphones through the walls, this dull monotonous drum beat just Plap Plap Plap Plap nonstop. It‚Äôs so annoying. Not to mention all the cans opening - why is she drinking Monster and listening to this rock music all night!? \n\nI NEED to find out what‚Äôs wrong with her.\n\n\n‚Äî\n\n01/07/25 - 12.03pm\n\nJune is finally out of her room and I finally got a look at the state of it. I cannot accurately describe what I found. I certainly don‚Äôt know how I feel.\n\nI was struck by the smell the moment the door blew open, a foul mixture of stale sweat, pungent energy drinks, and an oppressive heat in the air as it wafted past my nose. I crept forward, tiptoeing in a foot at a time for fear of her noticing me. Inching into the cesspit of her bedroom, I discover the scent epicentre. Half a dozen monster cans at various angles and with differing amounts of pale liquid still dripping from within them. Pillows discarded haphazardly with blahaj positioned as some form of centrepiece laying back against them. A mysterious puddle underneath it all, barely hidden by the duvet she clearly tugged up to try and cover it.\n\nAmidst the sticky rubble, I find her laptop- still playing the same music I heard before. At first I thought it was some kind of rhythm game but‚Ä¶ Is that‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs her? Bouncing on a big black dildo! I watch in abject horror as my older sister debases herself to the beat, slapping herself on the‚Ä¶ holy shit.\n\nI jotted down the account name but, Diary.. I have no idea what to do.\n\n‚Äî\n\n\n\n02/07/25 - 02.10am\n\nDear Diary,\n\nShe‚Äôs doing it again. That same soft Plap Plap Plap, those same little huffing whimpering breaths. I was disgusted all day. I couldn‚Äôt speak to her at dinner. So why am I here listening to her through the wall? And why do I have her reddit open on my phone?\n\nFuck it. I need to know how good it feels.\n\n‚Äî \n\n\nYour bedroom, right now.\n\nA DM appears on your screen from a new user with 0 karma. ‚ÄòJune. Fuck I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm reaching out like this. Just keep the noise down okay?‚Äô. Right as you go to reply, I open your bedroom door.\n\nThe moonlight from the landing floods into your room, transferring the gentle wash into an interrogative beaming. I watch as you throw the covers over yourself and scuttle to safety before reaching out from your fort to slam your laptop shut. ‚ÄòGod, you‚Äôre too cute for your own good, sis. I messaged you already, now stop pretending you don‚Äôt want this.‚Äô\n\nMy body compels me forward, my feet landing in the same grooves I trod only hours earlier between the loose sheets and boxes and clothes hangers still adorning your floor. I pause when I reach your bed, my hand coming down to stroke your shoulder through the blankets. ‚ÄòOpen up for Mommy, Puppy. I‚Äôve seen all of your posts. I know how much you‚Äôve wanted this‚Äô I murmur, my hot breath pooling on your cheek as you fake sleep, ‚ÄòI love you, big sis. And I want you.‚Äô\n\nYour face contorts at the three little words, a flicker of need whirring your fuzzy brain to life before you let your eyes reopen. They land on my needy, damp cameltoe since it‚Äôs eye level to you in your big bed, but I suddenly feel something completely new as they work their way up my body. I imagine the view from your position, seeing my ample, nightie-clad chest from below- my face peeking out between my breasts; seeing my needy, clingy hands curling at the corner of your duvet as I await my welcome to your bed; seeing my dripping pussy as I stand here in front of you, completely in control yet still completely powerless to your rejection. The smell of your bed is overwhelming me. The smell of my aching cunt is overwhelming you.\n\nI gasp as you pull the covers aside to unveil your lingerie-d body, your chest in a small yet tantalising bra, your bulge in equally attractive lace panties. I gasp louder as you press your face to my mound and groan, ‚ÄòLove you too, lil sis‚Ä¶ Pussy smells soo gooddd~ Arrrro‚Ä¶‚Äô.\n\n‚ÄòGood girl! Fuck, June, puppy.. Press your nose in! Mmmmffuck! Tell anyone about this and I will send them all your accounts!‚Äô I grunt, already climbing into your still slimy bed. Before I know it, my clothed pussy is grinding on your face and I‚Äôm panting ‚ÄòRefuse me‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ fuck! Yes lick it like that! Ugghhh~~‚Äô.\n\nI don‚Äôt think I have to worry about my big sis refusing me ever again.",

I watch in awe as you squirm slightly, giving you the space to bend and press your lips to my bush.\n\n\"Fuck, baby.. you a good girl?\" I grunt, gripping your hair and holding you to my crotch as you kiss the soft skin. You try to nod but it just drives me deeper into your throat.\n\nMy hand slides to your cheek, rubbing softly as I cherish you. I pull my hand away and ask if you're ready for me. As you nod, my hand slaps you right on the cheek where I rubbed just a few seconds ago. You fall off my cock, your sloppy lips still connected to me through spit and lust- your eyes wild and alive with need.\n\n\"Don't ever think bratting goes unpunished.\" I grunt swiftly before pulling back, watching as your needy body aches for me. You're dripping onto the clean sheets. Dirty girl.\n\nMy hand slides to your throat as I growl-¬†*What are you. Who do you belong to. What do you need.*\n\n\"Dumb slut.. You, Mommy.. You Mommy!!\". Your eyes are trained on mine, scouring for any hint of compassion as I stare back at you with a wild hunger.\n\nWhile you're distracted looking up at me, my hands are still wandering. The one on your throat tightens. The other has found your dripping cunt and a sole finger curls, the first joint of an index finger dipping into you and sliding from bottom to top- the nail grazing your swollen clit. You shudder and I suck my finger clean.\n\n\"Want this cock?\"\n\n*Wild nodding*\n\n\"Thought so.\"\n\n---\n\nMore on my subreddit r/Ms_Rs_Erotica but this is the one I'm proudest of. Would love feedback!",

      "selftext": "Hey gurls,\n\nJust wanted to let you know that commissions are open.\n\nIf you‚Äôve liked what I‚Äôve written publicly, understand that it barely scratches the surface. What I do best happens behind closed doors, where the writing runs longer, darker, filthier, more emotional. More *you.* More *me.*\n\nIf you‚Äôve got a fantasy, I‚Äôll build it. If you‚Äôve got a phrase that lingers in your head, I‚Äôll turn it into a world. Commissions are limitless (must be legal).\n\nI don‚Äôt charge money‚Äîyet. If you want something custom, all I ask is that you spoil me a little. I accept gifts through Steam, as linked in my profile. Think of it as fuelling the fire. Feed the voice and it‚Äôll reward you.\n\nThere‚Äôs no hard length limit, I‚Äôll keep going until it feels finished. Just give me the kinks and details on the scene and I can do the rest!\n\nThis is, as always, writing only. No pictures, no video, no calls, no voice. I‚Äôm not here to sell my body. I‚Äôm here to turn your thoughts inside out.\n\nIf you want something just for you, if you want to feel owned by a hot girl in your inbox, if you want to be told what to think and how to want‚Äîask.\n\nYou know how this goes. Give me a reason to write, and I will.\n\nLove you all",

I'm hunched over the side of the bed, the fan on full blast against me and blowing my hair frantically to rhythmically whip at my shoulders. I hear you sit up behind me and shrug off the sodden duvet. Your hands find my shoulders and sink into the strong, tight muscle. Just as I half-turn to see you, you plant a soppy kiss on my cheek and mutter,\n\n\\*\"I love you. I loved that. It was exactly what I needed. Thank you, Mommy....\"\\* You pause, still staring at me. \\*\"How was it for you? You did cum, right?\"\\*\n\nI chuckle heartily and spring from my solemn domme daze to kiss you and push you onto your back. \\*\"Of course I came, my love. You'd still be worshipping if I hadn't...

I see how you're leading the aftercare and don't know if I should resist it, I don't know if you even notice. With a final kiss, I push myself to my hands on knees, pulling back from you before grunting, \\*\"Just hopping in the shower.\"\\*\n\n\\*\"Okay, beautiful!\"\\* you chime, undercutting me completely. So you \\*had\\* noticed..\n\nTowel, robe, shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush, shower gel. Razor?

I decide against it but still take my long cool everything shower, emerging decadent in my robe and perfume and body hair.\n\nThe bathroom door swings open and I step out, ready to put you back in your place, but I catch you sat in the corridor wearing just a shit eating grin. You have my water bottle in one hand, and all of my old hair ties and bands and clips in the other.

Even if I try to bribe him with a tasty peanut butter treat he just ignores me and goes for it when I leave. He either freezes or hides when I just talk beside the cage (not opening it) and I am a bit worried about him.

I have had anorexia since I was 13 and have not been able to recover or stay at a healthy weight even with treatment. I had a period for a bit when I was doing better with eating but haven‚Äôt had one since last September. I know the obvious solution to my problem is to gain weight, but at this point that is not a realistic goal for me and I am looking for other methods of harm reduction I can use to at least prevent things from getting worse. \n\nMy PCP told me to take calcium and vitamin D. The issue with calcium supplements is that they exacerbate my chronic constipation, which makes me unable to eat, which obviously goes downhill really fast and will probably result in another hospitalization. I don‚Äôt tolerate dairy well either and I know it‚Äôs hard to get in enough nutrients with a very restricted diet so I figure supplements are the next best option. Anyone have recommendations for calcium supplements that don‚Äôt cause GI Problems? \n\nI would do weight bearing exercise, but I am supposed to limit exercise to prevent my weight from dropping even lower. I know my situation is really complex given my anorexia and GI problems, so I will be seeing a gastroenterologist and an endocrinologist soon. I just feel so stuck and tired because I feel like I‚Äôve dug myself into a hole so deep I can‚Äôt get out of with all my mental and physical health issues feeding into each other and making things worse ",

      "title": "It is so terrible to see parents neglect and/or enable their children with eating disorders",
      "selftext": "I've noticed an alarming pattern in a certain online ED community where a very young teenager is basically on death's door with severe medical complications, and the parents do not force them into treatment or even enable their ed. \n\nAnd of course since this space is an echo chamber or sick teenagers who resent their parents for forced treatment (and I get it - I hated my parents when they forced me into treatment as a teen, and I still have issues with them now as an adult because of it) everybody dogpiles on the parents and doctors for being so \"evil\" and \"abusive\" for forcing the patient to eat or gain weight. Obviously it's not a pleasant situation for anyone and it would be great if they wanted help, but what's the alternative? Letting your child starve to death? IMO, A child, especially in a state of severe malnutrition, does not have the cognitive capacity to make their own treatment decisions. As someone who was forced into treatment, I honestly don't think I would have made it past 15 if my parents let me do my own thing like I wanted. I am still very sick and forced treatment did not cure me (and the way my parents did it made things worse IMO), but at least I am alive and seeking help on my own now.\n\nWhat's even worse is seeing their parents not want them to get treatment either. Not going to name drop but there's this person whose parents went to court and lost custody over them for not consenting to life-saving ED treatment as recommended by the medical team. Most parents don't want to see their child suffer through forced treatment, but if the alternative was starving to death I think any rational parent would force treatment and not forcing them to go to treatment would be neglect. I understand it‚Äôs not an easy decision, especially since kids will often say ‚ÄúI will never eat/talk to you/I will hurt myself if you force me‚Äù (yeah, I tried all of those trust me I know)\n\nAnother example I saw was a parent letting their child with a BMI of >!! 11 !!< drive a car. If I was a parent, there is no way I would let my child in such a compromised state drive a car and endanger themselves and others. It's so terrible to see these kids suffer and the parents either not know how to help or don't want to help. I'm not trying to suggest that forced recovery is always a good option, but when it comes between life and death, something has to be done. I agree that complete psychological recovery cannot be forced, but you won‚Äôt even have a chance at it if you‚Äôre dead ",

I'm not surprised since I don't work out besides walking, and I definetly think I look skinny fat despite being significantly underweight by BMI. My maintnence calories are only around >! 1600 !< at my low weight and low activity level, and being short, and I'm terrified of gaining weight (obviously) so I don't want to eat above my maintnence. I feel like I should try to body recomp, so I don't look skinny fat and because I know resistance training can help with my bone density. I try to eat at least >! 70 !< g protein per day, which might not seem like that much but it's actually quite relative to how much I weigh.  I know it's hard to gain muscle when you don't eat enough but tbh even eating at maintnence is a huge step for me. I was thinking about getting some light weights (like 5-10 lbs) and doing workouts at home. Does anyone have advice? Is it even worth trying or am I wasting my effort?

I took one for my personality, then I switched gears and took one in Takuto's shoes and how the Persona 5 writers would categorise him. \n\nTurns out, *we're an absolute perfect match.* I'm an INFP (Mediator) and he's and INFJ (Advocate/Counselor - makes perfect sense), the rarest personality type in the world! We both have a compassionate and idealistic nature, and if we disagree on some things, when it comes to the important stuff, we're on the same page. We share a dedication to our ideals and a commitment to helping others. Although we may follow different paths, fundamentally, our goals are the same: to make the world a better place. This shared ethic gives us the opportunity for a deep and lasting bond! He's a lot more tidy than I am, and even though we share a lot of the same values, we're both very stubborn in our ways. Conflict is *extremely rare,* but conflict about morals or our core ideologies can get *explosive really fast.* I'm quicker to apologize and he's already thinking of a solution to our problem >!that doesn't involve him taking away my free will.!< I'm not surprised at the amount of positive chemistry we have, it was love at first sight.\n\n I'm going to link the Myers Briggs test [here](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) and please tell me your personality type, your S/O's personality type, and how you're supposed to get along romantically according to the types chart l, then how you *actually* get along together. It's going to be super interesting to see the results and super fun for everyone to learn more about their partner. I can't wait to hear about everyone's relationships!\n\nEdit: I guess INFJ isn't as rare as I thought! It's nice to see other diplomats out there",

He says a battle shouldn't take more than 10 turns. I asked him about his playstyle, and he doesn't use buffs or debuffs or even status ailments to make the fight more than just a damage fest. He even recognized a good way to deal with enemies with  no weakness is to get a critical hit but he does not use rebellion or Sukukaja to try and get them more often.\n\n \"I don't like enemies that force you to rely on chance\"\n\nGod forbid  he plays an SMT game.

      "selftext": "So 2 years ago I was prescribed Olanzepine. When my psychiatrist prescribed it, she told me hunger was just a feeling I'll have to live with, and to mitigate potential weight gain I'd have to exercise. And exercise I did! I was in my best shape ever, I could run for over an hour straight (~5 miles), deadlift 300 pounds, and do situps with 70+ pounds of resistance. Despite doing the One Punch Man workout every day and basically starving at 1400 cals a day, my weight stayed around 175 and my bmi at 28, body fat 27%. When I left home for school, I focused on my studies and less on my health and gained about 30 pounds in a semester and 4% more body fat. That's when my psychiatrist started me on Lybalvi (Olanzepine + Samidorphan). I had such a bad reaction to it we stopped it before week 2; extreme nausea and fatigue. Coming home for the summer I was only able to shake off about 17 pounds when I went back to my old exercise and eating intensity. This semester I gained it all back + about 5 pounds. We started the Tirzepatide compound in October and now I'm at 30 units of 5 mg for the next few weeks but I still have \"food noise\" and cravings, and even with exercise I'm only losing about as much as I would normally, and I'm abnormally tired, just like I was with Lybalvi.\n\nThe reason I'm posting this here is I'm worried about being resistant to Tirzepatide. Could it be that I'm not at a high enough dose? My doctor sent a 7.5 mg Rx that I'll be on soon.\n",

She and my sister (also a doctor) were talking and said that staying on the (incorrect) starting dose of 25 units instead of increasing would still benefit me.

If I manually press the sleep button from the power options, the screen will go black but it will not go to sleep. When trying to put the computer to sleep and I close the lid/put it away, I can still hear the notification sounds from discord messages so it is definitely still running. The only way I can get the computer to truly rest is to shut it down entirely. This is draining my battery life and it gets hot inside my backpack because the fan is still running.\n\nI should also mention that the laptop may have been modified as it was advertised as having 32 GB of RAM as opposed to the typical 8 or 16.",

So for 4 months, I‚Äôve been wanting to quit but have been dissuaded by their posts. I‚Äôd rather keep vaping than hurt my partner. And I don‚Äôt want to tell these friends that it‚Äôs affecting me negatively and preventing me from quitting, because I want them to be able to express their feelings about what‚Äôs happening to them. \n\nIt‚Äôs just really hard to see people talk about how hard someone else quitting is on them and then have to make the decision of ‚Äúdo I want to ruin people‚Äôs mental state or do I want to improve my own health?‚Äù\n\nedit: typo",

      "selftext": "I've been struggling with disordered eating since I was 11, I'm 17 now about to go into my senior year and I've been wrestling since my sophomore year. One of the BIGGEST parts of the sport is the weight class system-and on season I perform best at something a lot lower than my regular weight. When I started I had been quasi-recovered for about a year, probably the best relationship I've had with food in a while, and last year I was able to cut down at first without being disordered about it; but then some shitty life events happened and I fully relapsed and started spiraling. And by the time it got to its worst was around districts/regionals and then states, so I had no choice but to stick with the class I had been for most of the season instead of trying to recover because I have to religiously track my intake to maintain that weight.\n\nThe thing is, I literally can't perform well at my natural weight range, it's one of the most competitive classes in the sport and I have asthma so it's even worse when I'm around there. And I genuinely can't quit the sport because it's everything to me and the one thing I'm actually passionate about, and on top of that I'm a team captain and one of the best people on the team. Like fuck idk the coaches hail me for being a role model for never missing weight (because I obsess over it non-stop) and the other things I do for the team, but a major facet of the sport is absolutely horrific for my mental health.\n\nIdk I just had to vent about this on here because if I say *anything* about my history and present with disordered eating I won't be allowed to wrestle anymore-which might genuinely be worse for my mental health than dealing with what I do now.

He's got naturally feminine features that he's experienced insecurity over, he's also struggled with a lot of the mental health issues that I have, and we just stayed up talking about life and what it's like to be a man with those types of issues in this world. He doesn't know I'm trans, and he obviously isn't either, but we talked about people asking if you are trans (which he's had happen to him before, multiple times), being treated strangely, etc. \n\nThat experience really helped me get out of the pit I've been in recently about everything, because I've had nobody I could talk to about my issues; at least in the context of real life friends. It helped put into perspective how we're all just people, and that no matter what situation you're in there are people that *will* understand. I hope that hearing this story will help somebody in a similar situation to me as much as it helped me, or at least put into perspective that there's really not as much as a division between what trans and cis people go through as it may seem sometimes.\n\nThe world has been awfully cold to us lately, but it's not always as awful as it seems.",

Not even my school administrators because the ones that did know have all left.

It's eating me from the inside out, and I can't talk to anyone I'm close with about it because it could put me at risk (I live in a rural area). I feel like there's a wall between me and my close friends because they don't know what is, unfortunately, a massive part of my life. \n\nAnd I guess some of my pain about these things will be muted once I've had surgery, but what has really been getting to me is that I haven't met any other transsex guys like me. I've heard from some older stealth guys, which is nice, but I kind of just want a friend my age that understands me if you get what I mean. It feels impossible to find other trans men my age that aren't outwardly feminine, which I don't have a problem with--but I don't *relate to that whatsoeve*r. I know it's objectively not true, but I feel like I'm entirely alone in my situation.",

I am still covered by my mom‚Äôs BCBS Insurance therefore I am double insured. For some reason, select health gets put as my primary insurance\n\n1/2024:\nMy prior therapist (who also sees my mom) had mentioned something to my mom about select health denying my claims (I assume because they don‚Äôt cover mental or weren‚Äôt in her network etc) and that she is trying to work this out. \n\n3/2024:\nTherapist sends me a text asking to call both Insurance companies and ask them to update my coordination of benefits. I do this and tell her. She says ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs a waiting game and then we rebill‚Äù \n\nI hadn‚Äôt heard anything about the claims and my mom who seems to know more about this than me, told me not to worry. \n\nToday: \nMy therapist sends me a text today saying she has spent hours working with the insurance companies and to no avail, therefore I owe her $514.58. She tells me she originally filed with Regence who denied the claims due to double insurance  and the claims sent to Select Health went towards my deductible. She filed an appeal and they denied it. \n\nI called Select Health today who went over the EOB with me and explained the claims were denied due to the filing period exceeding and that this is a provider fault. Problem is I don‚Äôt know enough about insurance to know if her submitting these late was due to a timing issue on my end or if I really am at fault here. Thanks in advance ",

      "selftext": "I need advice for what to do about my dog barking in her crate. I got my dog in July and the program said she should stay in her crate for 45 min after eating to prevent her stomach from flipping. The issue is she will not stop barking and whining while in there.\n\nThey told us to say quiet when she does that but she immediately goes back to barking and whining. They also suggested ignoring her or pet corrector which both haven‚Äôt worked. If she barks I‚Äôm supposed to wait 10min of her being quiet before taking her out but this extends her time in the crate to almost 2 hours.\n\nShe is used for my anxiety and when she is barking and whining it makes me super anxious and my heart rate gets really high. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs separation anxiety but I can‚Äôt figure out a way to solve this and the program doesn‚Äôt really respond to my messages. \n\nEdit: I know she isn‚Äôt alerting my anxiety because she‚Äôs in a separate part of the house and her alert is to paw me, not bark. Also when I take her out she is usually panting a lot and her crate is wet from slobber.\n\nEdit: for everyone saying that I need to sue and that I‚Äôm with a horrible program, I am talking about this one issue. The program has been wonderful otherwise and she is very well trained, this is the only negative experience I‚Äôve had with them. Also the reason they weren‚Äôt responding was because of the fires in socal and they were very busy making sure all their dogs were safe and sending them to foster homes.",

They ofc responded with the typical narcissistic bs and shifted all the blame onto me and played the victim saying ‚Äúwell i guess we‚Äôre just shitty parents and we never did anything good for you‚Äù and ‚Äúwe just can‚Äôt do anything right for you‚Äù and my absolute favorite ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just so damn sensitive we can‚Äôt say anything around you‚Äù. This aggravated me beyond belief so i just gave up on the conversation and was like i knew i should‚Äôve never said anything. Fast forward to today as we‚Äôre eating lunch and they start making comments about their weight, how many calories they‚Äôre eating, exercise, etc. and i just had to sit there and listen to it cause i know they won‚Äôt listen anyways if i spoke up against it.

I had a huge binge of chocolate and sweets last night and followed the same advice of not restricting and i had a high protein breakfast. The biggest problem i‚Äôm facing is that once i‚Äôve ‚Äúallowed‚Äù myself to eat for the day then my body wants to go into the all or nothing mode and binge for the rest of the day. How can i get this mindset to go away while in recovery? I know recovery isn‚Äôt linear and there‚Äôs gonna be good and bad days but lately the mindset from the bad days are spilling over into the days i‚Äôm trying to be good. ",

      "title": "my health was put at severe risk today and my boss didn‚Äôt give a shit",
      "selftext": "As the title says my health was put in extreme jeopardy today due to a negligent and dumb fuck boss. We recently had a pretty bad winter storm here and the basement of one of his MANY properties had a small pipe burst and water got all over the walls and the walls started to mold. I was asked to go and clean this mess up for him before he brought someone in to repaint the walls and redo the floors which i was kinda pissed about having to do but did it anyways cause he‚Äôs the boss and ‚Äúgotta respect the authority‚Äù.  I was told prior to coming that i didn‚Äôt have to bring any equipment or cleaning supplies because he would have everything i needed so of course being the dumbass i am i took him at his word (BIG MISTAKE!) and of course when i arrived he has nothing i needed. The only supplies given were very loose fitting gloves and two gallons of 12% food grade hydrogen peroxide concentrate which he wanted me to use to clean the walls. This wouldn‚Äôt have been a problem if i was cleaning a room with proper ventilation but i wasn‚Äôt. I was made to clean the moldy walls and floors of the basement which had zero windows, zero ventilation and zero air purifiers or basically anything to negate the peroxide odors. After 4 hours of being in an enclosed basement and breathing in straight peroxide my eyes were burning/red, i couldn‚Äôt stop coughing and hacking up mucus, my head was pounding and my skin was starting to burn. My boss, of course was nowhere to be found as he was gone to another one of his again MANY properties. Finally after the 4 hours and not being able to breathe i went outside to get fresh air and that‚Äôs when the boss came back. He went to check the basement and immediately came back up coughing and complaining about the foul smell of the peroxide. I explained everything that was happening to me and the response was ‚Äúwell then we‚Äôll stop for today and you can come back tomorrow and finish and i‚Äôll see if i can pick you up a mask‚Äù no real concern for my health or current condition. Then i talked to my secondary boss and he basically said oh well not my problem and if you don‚Äôt like it just get another job. Also note that i got no extra compensation for my work today and am only gonna be paid my normal hourly rate. I‚Äôm beyond pissed off and can‚Äôt believe i have to put up with this shit.",

      "selftext": "My husband (29M) and I (27NB) recently got married (September 14, 2024) and my husband‚Äôs best friend, let‚Äôs call him Jeff, was a groomsman and gave a speech during our reception. I have hung out with Jeff only a few times as he lives 5 hours away, but he and his fianc√©e (we‚Äôll call her Amy) are fantastic people and gifted us a handsome amount of money as a wedding gift ($750 to be exact). Jeff and Amy will be getting married in May of this year and my husband will be a groomsman in the wedding. \n\nHere‚Äôs my problem: I am currently in the middle of an awful relapse of my eating disorder, and do not feel comfortable eating with strangers. This is pertinent because Amy is planning on having a head table with all the groomsmen and bridesmaids. This means I won‚Äôt be seated with my husband at a table and therefore will be surrounded by a bunch of people I have never even met for dinner. For some context, my husband and I had a sweetheart table at our wedding so that our wedding party members could sit with their significant others/friends at dinner time. \n\nWhile I recognize that my eating disorder is my own responsibility, this situation sounds extremely triggering for me. Not to mention that I don‚Äôt want to choose a meal just to have it served to me for me to not eat it. In front of a bunch of strangers. And if I DO try to eat in front of these strangers, I am fairly positive it will result in a panic attack and I do not want that happening at the wedding. \n\nSo my question is, would I be TA if I didn‚Äôt go? I don‚Äôt want to make my husband and I look bad by missing Jeff and Amy‚Äôs wedding (my husband will still be in attendance regardless), especially after their extremely generous gift. But I don‚Äôt think I can mentally handle being alone at a table with a bunch of strangers for dinner at this time. \n\n*I also posted this in another subreddit hence the format of my story*\n\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm relapsing HARD and can‚Äôt eat around strangers lol ",

      "title": "WIBTA for not attending a wedding? ",
      "selftext": "My husband (29M) and I (27NB) recently got married (September 14, 2024) and my husband‚Äôs best friend, let‚Äôs call him Jeff, was a groomsman and gave a speech during our reception. I have hung out with Jeff only a few times as he lives 5 hours away, but he and his fianc√©e (we‚Äôll call her Amy) are fantastic people and gifted us a handsome amount of money as a wedding gift ($750 to be exact). Jeff and Amy will be getting married in May of this year and my husband will be a groomsman in the wedding. \n\nHere‚Äôs my problem: I am currently in the middle of an awful relapse of my eating disorder, and do not feel comfortable eating with strangers. This is pertinent because Amy is planning on having a head table with all the groomsmen and bridesmaids. This means I won‚Äôt be seated with my husband at a table and therefore will be surrounded by a bunch of people I have never even met for dinner. For some context, my husband and I had a sweetheart table at our wedding so that our wedding party members could sit with their significant others/friends at dinner time. \n\nWhile I recognize that my eating disorder is my own responsibility, this situation sounds extremely triggering for me. Not to mention that I don‚Äôt want to choose a meal just to have it served to me for me to not eat it. In front of a bunch of strangers. And if I DO try to eat in front of these strangers, I am fairly positive it will result in a panic attack and I do not want that happening at the wedding. \n\nSo my question is, would I be TA if I didn‚Äôt go? I don‚Äôt want to make my husband and I look bad by missing Jeff and Amy‚Äôs wedding (my husband will still be in attendance regardless), especially after their extremely generous gift. But I don‚Äôt think I can mentally handle being alone at a table with a bunch of strangers for dinner at this time. \n\n*EDIT* I have mentioned this to my husband who said I could choose to not go to the wedding but I don‚Äôt think he seemed keen on the idea of that at all ",

      "selftext": "I, a 27 year old AFAB enbie, have an amazing fianc√©. He has been wonderful to me in ways I never imagined a person could be. And I‚Äôm worried about it. Let me explain. \n\nI have suffered from mental illnesses since I was a child, but am doing mostly better these last couple years with help from medications and therapy. I am also autistic. I currently work a full-time 9-5 job with the Canadian federal government. Keep in mind that only like 30% of autistics are employed in Canada. \n\nI am constantly exhausted and meltdowns and not uncommon. Because of this, my fianc√© handles 99% of things around the house; animal care, laundry, cooking, dishes, etc. I do what I can, when I can. But I‚Äôll admit it isn‚Äôt much, to my chagrin. He has NEVER ONCE complained about this arrangement, even going as far as reassuring me multiple times that he is okay doing everything. He works as a general contractor all day as well so it‚Äôs not  even like I‚Äôm the sole breadwinner. \n\nAfter getting out of an abusive relationship a few years ago, I always feel like I am always waiting for the other shoe to drop with my fianc√©. I know that isn‚Äôt fair to him. And I know I am an incredibly fortunate and privileged person to be in the situation that I am, I recognize that. And I‚Äôm in no position to be complaining. But I‚Äôm so scared that my fianc√© will eventually realize I‚Äôm too much of a burden and that everything will come to a head.",

I'm going to inpatient treatment for the frequency of my purging.

Physically, I am probably what one would describe as \"midsize\" but I honestly don't know what I look like anymore. Some days I think I look okay, normal. Others, all I see is a huge whale.

Anyway that caused a massive spiral and I ended up losing >!12lbs!< In about a week, slightly less. But now, despite eating the same amount of cals (more or less, usually less) and getting MORE daily steps in, I've stagnated???? Like I even GAINED a bit. \n\nCan someone please please please explain what the actual fart is going on??? Because I know about water retention and blah blah blah but by all means I should have LOST, not GAINED. \n\nAnyway I'm spiralling so this is fun",

      "selftext": "This might be long, apologies in advance. I'll leave a TLDR\n\nWe started fostering two puppies about 4 weeks ago. Littermates. They were estimated to be about 5 weeks old at the time but we still don't know the exact age.\n\nThings were getting better, they were sleeping through most of the night, playing very well together. Everything seemed great and we fell in love with one of them and ended up foster failing her. Her sister went to her new adoptive home two days ago and since then it's been HELL.\n\nShe cries all the time when in the crate, but like, crying that we've never heard before. It sounds like a wailing dolphin.\n\nShe pees in the crate. I work for 4 hours away from home and I'm worried that's too long to leave her alone, even though I left her and her sister alone for that amount of time. I take her outside immediately after taking her out of the crate and she pees maybe 60% of the time. She only recently was given the ok to go outside so we're still shifting away from pee pads so I guess she thinks going in the house is ok?\n\nShe's supposedly 9 weeks old now which I know is very young for a puppy (and tbh I think she might be a week younger) but should it be THIS hard? We have her signed up for puppy kindergarten starting in September but I'm worried that we made a mistake foster failing her. Maybe the puppy blues are just hitting me. I just need some reassurance.\n\nTldr: foster failed a now 9-week-old puppy and I feel like I am being a bad dog mom and like I can't do this.",

She also used to use diet pills which she quit because it messed with her mental health. (I wasn't aware of the last part until a few weeks ago.) \n\nMy sister, I don't think she really has a problem with eating but I remember us watching Harry Potter and when I went to use the restroom for a few minutes and when I came back she was just doing butterfly kicks or something and told me she had done like >! 300-400!< and just kept going. (This was when I was attempting to recover so I think you can guess where that went.) so maybe it isn't perfect. (She was also skinnier than me since I was in middle school or so I think.) \n\nSince elemantry school I have been skipping breakfast sometimes lunch, 1-2 round bread for lunch and only eating when I got home in weekdays. (Which I still ended up fat.) \n\nMy mom would also force me to eat and guilt me or get mad if I didn't as a kid. \n\nI always felt so ashamed to be compared to my mom because I was fat while my sister was compared to my dad as she was skinny. \n\nI don't think I had a chance to have a healthy relationship with food like, ever. \n\nIdk but I hope I get to have a better life next time lol.

The weirdest part is I have been questioning my own gender identity for years and I think I might be under the genderfluid umbrella but I don't like the idea of it either. I used to think of it a lot but it just makesmes extremely uncomfortable to think about so I try not to think about it even tho I go by He/Him or all in online spaces as a girl. \n\nI've had a similar problem with female characters tho I got over it and I think it was most likely my relationship with women in my life but LGBTQ+ people have never affected me so I don't know why I feel this way.

      "selftext": "I feel like everyone hit rock bottom as of lately, including me. I won't get into detail of my life and rocks it threw at me like im the devil but as long as I can remember I've always had thoughts about being a massive burden and passive suicidal ideation. I didn't understand why my parents kept me alive or took care of me as they never gained anything from me in return and I even became a burden both financially and emotionally. Life always sucked for me but for the past year it wasn't bad, not because I wanted to live but instead suppressed my suicidal thoughts with obsession of food and weight loss which almost made me completely forget of it all. But I gained most of the weight back and can't control myself anymore, and even when I can the thoughts are still there. \n\nI'm not religious, I started questioning at elementary school. For me it's either nothing or reincarnation and I'm fine with both. \nLately I've been just yelling and ignoring my family for the most part and suicide doesn't seem that scary anymore. I sit on the window still, sometimes let my leg hang out. I think I would do it if I didn't think and just let it. I know I won't but I think I would if I really wanted to.\nThis sounds so dumb but I think I'm just living for stupid videos. Like the first thing that comes to my mind thinking about it is \"But I want to keep watching them\"\nI don't really care about my family or friends as ashamed as I am to admit to this. \n\nFor the past while I've been just thinking of taking the metro and going far away and jumping off a building there and I know I won't do it but it feels more so like a plan \"just in case\"\nWould this considered passive or active?

      "selftext": "I hate my dad for always being more interested talking with my sister. I remember crying seeing a photo of them 3 together because not even one of them would even play with me let alone all of them together with me. Since childhood it felt like I walked into a house as a stranger and became the burglar stealing their joy. I always tried to keep silent, I didn't ask for toys or help with homework since seemingly my pure presence was a burden to them. I struggled so much behind clear glass waiting for them to say something yet no one noticed or cared. I stopped taking care of my hyegine, didn't talk in school or in the house for nearly a school year, cut myself for a bit, I had paranoia, suicidal and homocidal thoughts, I fucking stopped eating but none of it seemed to work. My dad isn't the type to get agressive or even yell, only raises his voice but I wished he had hit me instead, I hate how his voice turns back to normal like nothing happened. Maybe if he had hit me there would've been proof of my existence, maybe he would say sorry, maybe he would take me out somewhere as a sorry gift. I lost so much weight and gained it back for nothing. I waited for them to force me into a hospital, I expected our relationship to get better like in movies. \n\nBut it didn't. They didn't call for help. My heart beat would drop under 40 a minute and my thoughts about going to the hospital and a better relationship turned into when and how I would die. It hurt to lay on my bed because I could feel my bones poking. I couldn't breathe. I was like an old women rushing to the bathroom because my pelvic floor muscles were wasting away. I started having heartburns I never had before. I thought when I gained weight we would be closer. \n\nI wish I fucking let myself die. \n\nI don't have the balls to slit my throat or jump off a building but starving to death felt like heaven. I didn't feel suicidal anymore, I stopped crying everyday, for once in my life I felt invincible. If I didn't see it bleed, if it didn't hurt as much, if I couldn't see my insides and see how fucked up it all were it meant I wasn't dying.\n\nNone of it felt real. \n\nBut I fucking gained the weight back. Nothing changed. I can't even starve like I used to, but when I'm able to I won't stop untill my last breathe. My death will prove how neglectful they were. I hope they won't be able to sleep without guilt. I don't want them to die, I want them to suffer with the consequences. They could've just given me away if it was that hard to acknowledge my existence. I know I would've been happier. ",

The shame I felt  when I stood next to my sister who's 11 years older than me, because I weighted far more than her probably all my life. The time I realized my own dad that is taller than me and a grown man was skinnier than me. The disgusting looks people gave me because I was fat. The embarrassment I felt because I felt hungry, all those times I let my stomach rumble in the classroom knowing everyone could hear it. At elementary school I hoped I died before 13 because it already felt like too much and I was sure I would go to hell if I attemted suicide after 13.\n\nThis school year was probably the best year of my life. I can't remember anything, I was obsessed with fasting and steps and food but for once I was able to look in the mirror and don't want to die. I almost never even thought about suicide the entire time. I actually wore things that I liked, that showed skin. For the first time I didn't feel ashamed for eating too much because I knew I would burn them later anyway. \n\nI was happy when I looked sick. Nobody had cared about me before when I didn't take showers or didn't talk. I had paranoia, thought humanoid creatures were watching and following me. Thoughts about suicide and homocide were common. Only time anyone said a thing was when I was skinny. I loved parting my hair so they could see my bones from the back, as if to prove I was sick. \n\nBut I gained the weight back, I thought I wanted recovery but I was wrong. I've never been more suicidal.It only now realized that I would rather die young like this than to live like that ever again. I feel bad feeling this way as seeing how this has ruined others life, but it's the only thing that adds a meaning to mine. ",

I gained about >! 20kg !<(I was severely uw prior now at a normal weight but look fat) and I truely don't know how to spend time besides eating. \nPrior to me gaining weight I would religiosly walk and exercise(untill I had to stop due to my bones hurting) and the days that I did eat I would eat very slowly to the point of sitting on the table watching youtube for 2 hours straight. I litterally wouldn't do anything else, as soon as I finished exercising I would sleep, the next day when I did get to eat it took hours and the next day I would take a shower before sleeping. I would litterally only watch youtube while exercising or on the days I ate I was like a living zombie. \nNow that I'm eating I don't know what to do. I don't want to read, write, play games, watch videos or hang out with friends. Sure they are fun but It's like a mental block just stopping me from doing them. I don't go out because I'm too ashamed so I'm stuck at home I'm just eating so the time will pass. I was having breakdowns every other day back then and now too I still have them, probably worse even. I'm scared of my mental health getting worse and I'm already starting to havebadh hygieneanda maybe am becoming paranoid(which has happened before) and I'm terrified I will get bad again. I'm thinking maybe have a plan day to day because I think thats how I was able to manage but I can't even get out of the bed sometimes I truely don't know what to do. ",

      "selftext": "Hello! So basically my parents told me on November 9th that they were planning a family holiday for us from the 21st to the 28th of December. When we had previously discussed going away for Christmas I told them that I needed to know ASAP so that I could request a holiday for the very busy Christmas period, so it‚Äôs fairly annoying that they‚Äôve left it so late to tell me. \n\nSince I‚Äôm at university, I work across two different branches during term time versus the holidays, so I haven‚Äôt worked at the branch that the holiday affects since the very start of September. \n\nI messaged the manager from my home store to request it, but how likely is it that I‚Äôll be given the time off?\n",
