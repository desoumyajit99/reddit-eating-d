n573iva,Wonderful-Flan1064,"oml, closest experience i have was buying dumbbells and hiding them, i just out 'em in my backpack that i use for college tho.

bUT when i bought a scale years ago i went out when no one was in the house, walking like at night which i wasn't allowed to do, then ended up taking a taxi back lmao.

uhm my mom i think did see the scale cuz she's entered my room before when i wasn't in the house n my dumbass stopped hiding it before i go out, but, don't think she thought of it much cuz umm, she was more distracted with the little section on my wall with my weight written down lmao.

fun fact: she never mentioned it (year and a half ago at this point) i heard about it from my brother. girlie (my mother) cried apparently and brother told her it's curiosity n that i was weighing myself before n after üí©.

i heard that and my brain went, why tf is that your first thought?? he's so ed coded üò≠ (previous gym bro)

n2h53sz,Lotta-Cat,"When I got through therapy, I thought my emotions where too strong and often irrational. I thought this was my main problem, and the eating disorder was a result of this. Turned out to be very wrong. My emotions were the only healthy thing left in my mental health. I was just very overwhelmed and confused, because I never learned how to regulate myself. Instead my parents always told me my emotions were wrong and too strong. My way of healing was to slowly detect the lies they told me and find new ways of viewing myself. This way the intense pressure I put myself under to be perfect in every way, slowly went down. I don't need to be perfect to be loved. I don't need to be easy and always helping. I am allowed to have my own needs and it's not bad to put them first, before serving others. 

Idk if any of this sounds familiar, but but my case isn't rare. A lot of emotional immature parents try to regulate themselves with their children and don't understand their needs. This often leads to issues like eating disorders, because it's another way of getting perfect to be lovable. But the thing is, no matter how complicated a kids needs are, they all deserve unconditional love. And as soon as they don't get that love, they will find excuses for the lacking love of their parents. This excuses usually blame the child, because it's easier to accept that you are the problem and can change to be loved, instead of accepting that no matter what you do, you are utterly alone and helpless, because your parents are not gonna protect you.

I hope this helps to find some topics to talk about, or even better you don't relate and didn't had to go through this.

Or maybe you think you don't relate, but in reality you do, you just don't discovered ot yet. At the beginning of my therapy I was convinced my parents gave their best, and I am just ungrateful because I can't be happy and have all this weird emotions.",1752199093.0,2025-07-11T01:58:13+00:00,15,t3_1lwo9cg,t3_1lwo9cg

In general eds tend to very often stem from trauma tho and our eating habits are simply a way for us to distract ourselves as well as to cope, so perhaps she's trying to get you to open up regarding past experiences because if there's trauma and there most likely is it's the very thing that is the cause of the food issues.

Like I'm in pain from surgery and *still* horny. Hypersexual women exist, mine is a side-effect of neurodivergence. Dating has been particularly difficult for me. True connections are hard to find. Most men treat me like shit when the find out I have a high sex drive, because I must be a slut. I'm not. You must have Daddy issues - I don't. I don't sleep around or have one-night stands. 

I've been treated like shit regardless of when I share that information. Waited a month a few times to share with my steady date - it was like I flipped a switch and the personality changed. 

My love language is gifts, acts of service, words of affirmation. I have two older brothers and a great father who offer awesome guidance. They came to the conclusion that single men in my generation that are confident in approaching are only interested in sex, and I'm better off joining activities. Which turn out to be mostly women. Bumble changed how the app operates, so I can't initiate every time, don't like that. 

I've stopped dating altogether. Tried for a bit last summer after not dating for two years. Yeah, I pull attractive connections, especially women. No real connection, most just want a FWB sitch. Not gonna pay for a matchmaker, don't believe in that approach. 

At this point, I no longer believe that love is possible for me. People with ASD have lower success rates in marriage and relationships, and their partners often have a lower satisfaction rate compared to neurotypicals. Combine that with my age and the political tilt of the single men in the area I live. Yeah, I'm fucked in a terrible way. Just really depressing. üòî

mg5yst0,ChilledParadox,"No worries, I‚Äôm happy you felt comfortable sharing that and I hope you felt some catharsis from verbalizing the feelings you‚Äôve internalized. 

It makes me sad that you‚Äôve had people treat you like shit when you share your preferences. I wish I could say it was surprising, but honestly, it‚Äôs not to me anymore. I‚Äôve become very cynical when it comes to the nature of my fellow humans and the general lack of empathy scares me. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, I know there are some people out there that would be perfect for you. My roommate in college was a physics major with bad ADHD and a high sex-drive, but he was liberal, empathetic, and was able to find some women that fit his inclinations during our time together. 

We also have the same love language, so again, I know there are people out there who would love you and reciprocate. When I was in a highschool relationship my girlfriend and I would make handmade silly gifts that reminded us of each other. One year she bought me a box of couscous, poptarts, a memento from a trip abroad to Spain, and socks. Each gift was cheap and seemingly random, but attached with each one was a card she wrote explaining the meaning of the gift and how it related to me and something she observed about me. It‚Äôs been a decade since then and I still have the cards. I read them occasionally, though unfortunately that entire era is emotional for me to remember. In return I would do similar things, draw her pictures, listen to what she said and try to help out where I could. If she had a test I‚Äôd learn the material to help her study, if she had something coming up I‚Äôd help her out with chores at her house to give her more time to focus. Stuff like that. 

I can‚Äôt offer advice on dating profiles. I don‚Äôt use dating apps and the last time I did I found half
My matches were bots and the other half I just wouldn‚Äôt vibe well enough with so I‚Äôd never even bother to make dates, just send a few messages and then ghost the girl because the conversations felt vapid and empty.

I get what you mean with the political situation. I won‚Äôt date republicans. Republican women are the strangest thing to me, like they want to repress themselves and be subservient to some dude with a breeding fetish. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ well I don‚Äôt like it. I‚Äôm in Michigan, which Trump won, so it‚Äôs not great at the moment. 

If I had to offer you advice, it would be this: 

Don‚Äôt focus on finding a relationship. Focus on doing what you want and being happy. Focus on your hobbies. Focus on being yourself. I don‚Äôt know what sort of mental baggage you‚Äôre carrying but I have diabetes, hypothyroidism, major depression, acute anxiety, and a CPTSD diagnosis from an abusive upbringing. Even with that laundry list of red flags I‚Äôve found dates before and I‚Äôm not the most attractive now. Maybe I once was, but I‚Äôve lived alone since 17 and had a poor foundation, it‚Äôs led to physical defects from health issues like in my teeth so I won‚Äôt even bother to date until I can fix them and I‚Äôm happy with myself again. 

I think once you‚Äôre in your own niche and you‚Äôre happy with yourself relationships will come naturally from there. People will see you smiling and having a good time and gravitate towards you because people being happy with themselves is always hot. I can‚Äôt offer advice about dealing with a high sex-drive. I have an above average sex-drive but there‚Äôs no stigma with men. Usually that means I just masturbate a lot because I‚Äôm overly cautious about inflicting my desires on other people. 

I wouldn‚Äôt worry about your age. There are lots of people who enjoy older women. Like I have a Dommy mommy fetish. It‚Äôs not the only thing I like, but a mature woman being upfront about sex and coercing me to do what she wants is peak. In general I hate dating women much younger than me because of the mental maturity gap. I like having conversations and discussions and arguments and I hate dealing with ditzy stupid women. Strong independent women with their own desires so I can help them achieve their dreams is where it‚Äôs at. 

Sorry this was long and I feel I made it too much about myself, but that‚Äôs how I draw from my experience to try to help people. I do think there‚Äôs hope for you and I know things suck right now, but all things change with time. You just need to wait for what you see as a good opportunity and pounce on it. I believe in you.",1741190632.0,2025-03-05T16:03:52+00:00,6,t1_mg5sa49,t3_1j2x6rp

mg7b1i7,Bit36G,"Thank you - I appreciate you sharing. There were a lot of things I needed to ""hear"" in your response. Crying in a good way. There's a lot of baggage that I've worked through but more recently started going through the hoops for ASD and possibly AuD/AuDHD diagnosis. I've got another referral for someone who has more credentials in more areas, so I'll move forward with that. My grandpa was bipolar, I think my brother is, so they wanted someone with a stronger background in that, anxiety disorders, and ASD. It's hard to find help specific to adult ASD here in MN. There's not even a waitlist for the ASD society here, they're so full.

So I'm going to the specialist my PCP referred me to is able to help. I know what you mean about MI - MN is a purple state because the cities are blue. But there's a lot of red counties in the metro burbs, and predominantly matches would be Republicans that hid that they were Republican, or didn't realize their views were. 

I'm taller (5'8"") and a switch, so it'd be nice to find a guy who also is. It's weird that they all liked to be dominated - like damn near 100% - and then act sexist when we didn't have sex, talk down to me, be cocky when making overly disgusting sexual comments in public, shame me for saying it's inappropriate to talk to me that way. Ugh I'm so sick of kissing frogs, which is why I stopped dating. 

So the stories about your experience and your friends helps. Reading about your high school one made me sad, I've never experienced that kind of love and joy in a relationship. Though it does boost my outlook. Maybe I will keep an eye out for that opportunity. I've been focusing on myself and what I want (like I'm studying in Japan this summer!!!) so if there is an opportunity that occurs organically, I will jump. 

Hoping for CBT or DBT to better handle triggering situations (hate how that's so overused by people without a mental illness - also have anxiety and minor bouts of depression, I love the meds I'm on, I wake up happy most days, kind of weird since I'm not used to it).

It's expensive, you usually gain weight, you have a meal plan and eat in a cafeteria, you sleep in dorms, you learn new skills, you go to classes (well, groups) - there are even final exams, they just involve eating pizza and cake without crying instead of writing a bunch of facts down on paper. You tend to make friends and/or enemies there, and sometimes find yourself in an ill-advised situationship (er, hopefully that isn't just a me thing). Eventually you graduate with the hope that the experience will help you live a better life - and sometimes life doesn't go so well afterwards, so you end up going back because you don't know what else to do. üôÉ",1751259548.0,2025-06-30T04:59:08+00:00,36,t3_1lnx0um,t3_1lnx0um

Also I objectively think labels are stupid. Like I understand when it‚Äôs necessary for medication but I avoided getting a dx at all costs. I‚Äôve never understood needing a specific label to feel valid in this specific disease. Logistically an ED diagnosis fucks with your chances of getting good life insurance and how medical professionals treat you down the line.

my argument is that with the current diagnostic methods used for anorexia, the gap between case A and case B can be SO WIDE that case A and case B seem like two totally different conditions but both be called ‚Äúanorexia‚Äù. that doesn‚Äôt mean that case A doesn‚Äôt exist or that case A didn‚Äôt suffer, but it does mean that it may not be best to categorize case A and case B the same. moreover, when case A and case B are wrongly joined together, case B‚Äôs severity can get overlooked and adequate treatments aren‚Äôt developed because people assume it is the same as case A. talk about gaslighting.

so perhaps it‚Äôs best we move on from fitting a broad range into one diagnostic umbrella. you can see this same argument made in the autistic community. many autistic people argue against severity labels, but others argue for them stating that using the vague ‚Äúspectrum‚Äù label to claim that no case is more severe than another actually denies valuable treatment to more severe cases.  in reality, the ‚Äúspectrum‚Äù is a spectrum of severity.

it‚Äôs the same for anorexia. the problem is anorexics all want to be the most severe so we have this whole issue where we must tiptoe around and avoid invalidating anyone.",1747613249.0,2025-05-19T00:07:29+00:00,13,t1_mt1g6ey,t3_1kptj3x

I literally don't feel sexual attraction and when I DO it's very rare and very muted and is always overridden by the romantic attraction. It's just not something I think about or want or need and I've always been this way.

I hate most of all that I gave up that piece of me for someone else that literally DID NOT CARE and so desperately wanted me to have the same raging sex drive as him. He just wouldn't get OFF OF ME (he never r-worded me or anything he was just always feeling me up and I'd always have to be that ""mean gf"" and tell him I wasn't in the mood)

I guess that's where the ""Realising it was SA"" comes in. He did do that a couple times but it was subtle and could be passed off as miscommunication but it was DEFINITELY SA. But nothing like r&p3 so idk",1747137799.0,2025-05-13T12:03:19+00:00,4,t3_1kk882t,t3_1kk882t

The majority of people, for example, with anorexia, fall into the ""atypical"" category specifically because of their bmi even though most doctors acknowledge that bmi is fucking arbitrary and health issues as a result from eds happen at ALL weights/bmi categories. 
I understand why these criteria were made, but eds are much too prevalent to invalidate a person who definitely has issues when these disorders often feed off of not feeling sick enough. It's a hell of a lot easier to prevent things from getting worse and validate each other for our struggles as they are than it is to keep seeing people suffer and give each other imposter's syndrome.",1746246025.0,2025-05-03T04:20:25+00:00,36,t3_1kdjrhj,t3_1kdjrhj

mqivtng,TheseFreedom6691,"I have quite a few lmao.

1. People who aren't diagnosed tend to misdiagnose themselves 99% of the time due to the fact that alot of these people think Ed's are either Ana or mia. Ednos is probably wayyy more common amongst the ed community but no one would ever know that because people think they either have mia or Ana only.

2. I keep seeing people who binge without purging claim they are bulimic. That's just wrong.

3. Some people don't have eating disorders, they just wanna lose weight quick. Skipping breakfast and reducing caloric intake does NOT make you disordered.

4. I've seen too many overweight/obese people claim that they are anorexic, and that literally makes me laugh every single time. A literal criterion for Ana diagnosis is to be underweight, which these people are not. They think starving for a day makes them anorexic, and that pisses me tf off.

5. Anyone who claims they average over 100 000 steps a day is lying and they're rigging the system. Unless they literally eat as many calories as they burn off, there is no chance they are able to consistently hit 100k steps.

6. Liars are the worst thing to happen to the ed community. All people are trying to do nowadays is one up everyone so they appear more disordered or sick, and it's so harmful. Some of these lies are actually getting out of hand, because tell me why I keep seeing people claim they lost 5kgs in 3 days? people claim they walked 120k steps in a day? people claim they hit bmi 8? people claim they have fasted for over 96 hours without any caloric intake? Lmfao, I saw some claim they dry fasted for a monthü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it's embarrasing and harmful, and all it does is make people try and obtain some crazy standard of illness which is literally not humanly possible.

7. If you make you're entire personality and lifestyle centre around recovery, then you are not truly recovered.

8. People have no idea what body dysmorphia is anymore and they just fake it for attention. People keep posting body checks of their toothpick arms and call themselves fat. People post themselves wrapping their hand around their thigh and asking people if they look like a hippo. I've seen countless girl post body checks of themselves while inpatient and asking if they look like a beluga whale, knowing damn well they don't. It's super harmful and just attention seeking. How do I know this? Because I genuinely have body dysmorphia and even thinking about posting a single picture of myself for the whole internet to scrutinize makes my skin crawl and causes me nausea. 

9. Some folks on edtwt are insufferable. They make tweets saying ""I just saw someone with bmi 50""ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è pls dpmo. They act as if overweight people or people with BED aren't really disordered and they do t take them seriously enough. It's so strange seeing people act surprised at bmi 60 when we have seen people with bmi 7. Coming from an anorexic, if I were to ever post on twt as someone with BED, id probably have suicidal tendencies because of the way people treat people with BED. WE ARE ALL DISORDERED

I think that's all for now. I know this is super long, but I've seen too many thing that js make my blood boil yet I don't see anyone talk about it.

mqel9l1,PsychoKatzee,"1. **EDs are very fucking competitive.**   
You see a random skinny person, and your brain instantly clicks. ""Do they have and ed?? They surely do. They must be better at it than me. Or if they don't? Are they just naturally skinny??"" You'll be jealous. You stare. 

2. **Your brain is rewired**.   
Outsiders can't understand, how it feels like when your brain rewards you for literally slowly killing it. Things that damage you fill you with feeling of success. You watch yourself deteriorate. Things that give other people pleasure fill you with guilt. Numbers become the only thing you really care about. Measurements. Eating becomes a drag. 

3. **It's fucking isolating.**   
The deeper you get, the bigger the part of your life you can't talk about gets. You begin avoiding every occasion that potentially involves calories, cause it gives you anxiety. You are terrified of being discovered, so after a while you just don't go. They either notice, so you begin lying, or you just don't go anymore. You will get lonelier, and I believe that is the most horrible part, and why it's so dangerous. You lose pleasure. 

**4. You think you're in control, but you aren't.**  
You might see extreme bonespo and think you won't get that far, you can stop any time. Thing is, it's a **behavioral addiction.** You might begin bargaining with it, but eventually gonna slip. Seeing that kind of stuff slowly becomes a secret goal you might not even admit to yourself. 

**5. They will notice eventually**

mqn7z1x,rleaff1,"That's been pretty much word-for-word my experience too. For me, it took my organs actually starting to fail for it to finally click for me that this might actually, in fact, be severe anorexia, not just occasionally ""weird with food."" I had a... bad medical event, alone, but survived just fine without intervention by pure dumb luck. But in the time after that, I was still constantly convinced I was dying, imminently, at all times, every single time my fucked-up body did anything even remotely fucked-up.

Which was (and still is) pretty often. So now that I've been scared off by almost dying alone in the bathroom from this goddamn illness, I've been forced to acknowledge it and realize how bad I've become. Because of the constant denial of my eating disorder, both from myself and the world, it only burrowed deeper and deeper into my perception of normal. I got worse and worse for years and years without even realizing. I genuinely thought I was perfectly healthy and functional, all things considered.

It's weird seeing the past with so much unpleasant clarity... recovering enough to make my brain work again probably helps. Starting a mood stabilizer that actually works on me has probably been a factor too. But I can't just ""recover"" as if it's a virus or something that will leave permanently. I can't unwire the thought patterns. I already feel like I was exaggerating or being dramatic back then, or that I measured wrong, or I wasn't actually in danger, etc etc etc. If I don't replace it with another coping mechanism soon, I'm gonna instinctively go right back to trying to control my life through my body. Which is the cycle of the disorder controlling me, ironically. 

My perception  of myself and my past is distorted, which is part of the eating disorder, and I know that, but my mind still takes it all in before I can catch it. The absolute lack of other witnesses means all I have as a record is my own memory and some photos. It's so hard to know what's real. It's so hard to get help when your disorder is extremely private and intentionally hidden.

This has gotten longer than I meant for it to be. I'm not trying to write a whole personal narrative, lol.

mr7b3lu,carotenemia,"I have been an undisciplined anorexic! Beyond undisciplined, completely disastrous, even long before I ever started binging, or, subsequently, purging. I think it requires discipline to be a certain kind of anorexic. someone who like, leans ortho. but eating in a redundant, extreme deficit was very easy, just ride out the inertia. I ate a lot of oatmeal and chewed a lot of gum, drank a lot of monster. Eat (insert number) of quest bars a day, rinse/repeat, requires so much less discipline than eating like a normal human being. Much, much easier than trying to eat enough, but not too much, get the right macros, etc. etc. and eating different shit all the time, instead of the same shit over and over.

My flammable take is: 

There is such a thing at being ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù at an eating disorder. I, personally, was ok at orthorexia, good at anorexia, then bad, then very very good, then, briefly, bad again, then absolutely godly at bulimia, could win some sort of award or something. Guinness book. Of course it‚Äôs not *a good thing* to be good at an eating disorder. It‚Äôs fucked. But I think, like other people in this thread have said, some people (not all, and I wasn‚Äôt one of them) sort of do choose to peruse anorexia specifically, and a lack of success can be disuasive. I think there is such a thing as like, acute adolescent anorexia (or other restrictive ed) that only lasts around a year, and it is p different from chronic or persistent anorexia. (This also speaks to what you said abt the little voice, I think the former can recover without it, but for the latter it‚Äôs calcified as a part of who you are as a person, it just gets louder or quieter) 

Also BED prob, atp, has a higher mortality rate from complications than AN, it‚Äôs just way, way underdiagnosed, as binge eating and compulsive overeating is more culturally normalized than starving oneself.",1746685350.0,2025-05-08T06:22:30+00:00,2,t1_mqlflyc,t3_1kdjrhj

I will never tell a young person that it‚Äôs ok to not pursue treatment, and ultimately at that age it kind of isn‚Äôt up to you.

I doubt anything you say would convince your parents or team to just say ‚Äúok cool you can not do treatment, have a nice life‚Äù. You‚Äôre young, and chances are you haven‚Äôt had a long, enduring, entrenched illness so your chances of recovering and being able to live a full, happy, free life are better now. I advise you to really take this chance to give treatment your all and get this behind you. 

That being said, it‚Äôs true that although, as a minor, they CAN make you gain weight and normalize your eating habits, only you can make the decision to commit to recovery and do the psychological work needed to truly get better. I can‚Äôt just tell you to do that, your team can‚Äôt make you, and it isn‚Äôt wrong to not want to recover. I‚Äôd argue that not wanting to recover is pretty normal, especially in the earlier years of illness. So, you‚Äôre kind of at a crossroads here. You‚Äôre probably going to have to do treatment of some kind whether you want to or not, but you can choose to get as much as you can out of that and really give it your best shot, or you can half-ass things and get through it without really giving recovery a chance.

mmfv9w2,LoveThatForYouBebe,"And I completely disagree with you, having the exact opposite experience. Sanford doesn‚Äôt let you participate in the exercise group/group fitness unless the exercise physiologist clears you and you‚Äôre meeting your exchanges. And fitness group is never a full hour long. It‚Äôs on the schedule for an hour, but it takes time to get changes, get started, etc., and they have individual plans for each patient, so if someone needs more limits on the time they‚Äôre doing whatever activity, they‚Äôll be stopped after that time. 

They are also the only place in the country who has a dedicated SEED track alongside their normal track (which has pluses and minuses depending on the patient population), so they‚Äôre super well informed ahhh medical comorbidities and issues that arise. Saying this as someone who had a laundry list of pretty obscure medical needs and accommodations and they are usually willing to help figure out solutions if you are. They went above and beyond when no one else could or would even try to figure out solutions to obtaining HLOC.

I have outside insurance through my spouse, but am also on disability, so I‚Äôm required to have Medicare as secondary, and Sanford is one of the only places in the country who can treat high risk medical cases who receive govt. assistance., whether Medicare or Medicaid. ACUTE also now often refers people there when they call and are on govt. programs and can‚Äôt even do an actual admission call with ACUTE as a result.

All that said, I hold space for the fact the environment and energy can be wildly different based on the patient group at any given time (I‚Äôve been there with vastly differing milieus over a span of a couple/few months), and I‚Äôm sorry your experience there wasn‚Äôt a good one. I‚Äôve had some bad social environments, and some really good ones, even within the same stay, as some patients left and others arrived.

That‚Äôs why I included, in my original comment, the caveat that while I know personal horror stories from ACUTE (from others I know 1:1, and from trying to deal with them to get admitted, which was a shitshow), others have better experiences. I‚Äôm glad ACUTE was good for you, and I‚Äôm also glad Sanford saved my life and was willing to help when ACUTE refuses to do the red tape work needed to make SCA for those on Medicare/medicaid. So I‚Äôm just glad there are options out there for those of us who may need them. <3",1744313164.0,2025-04-10T19:26:04+00:00,5,t1_mmer6pt,t3_1jvrbc4

mls4iih,withcorruptedlungs,"Agreed. Even the fully grown women who attended didn't deserve to be put through those kinds of fucked up mirror gimmicks tbh, but it's the kind of thing that can seriously warp the mind of a child. It's really no wonder that I turn 40 this year and yet still struggle almost as much with my ED as I did in my teens. 

I mean, my mother was mentally ill and so you can't apply logic to her behaviour, but it boggles my mind that the WW people didn't refuse me entry or at least question my mother about why she was enrolling her (slightly chubby at best, I mostly just had some baby fat) 9-year-old in the program. They were totally on board with it and weighed me in in front of everyone each week, scolding me if I lost weight or strayed from the meal plan, letting me contribute my shameful food stories in the meeting discussions, etc etc - as if I were one of the other middle-aged women who attended. 

Like, I remember in one meeting they did this ""final straw"" exercise where they handed a straw around and each person would talk about the ""final straw"" that made them want to start losing weight. Most of the ladies there were talking about developing health conditions, or not being able to keep up with their kids, problems at work, etc - and I remember when it got to me, I was like on the verge of tears all ""*When I went back-to-school shopping, I couldn't buy clothes in the girls section anymore, I had to shop in the teen juniors section to find clothes that were big enough.*"" Like, I'm kind of laughing as I remember, because it sounds like an SNL skit or something hahaha. And most absurdly/hilariously of all, instead of questioning it, the leader and all the other ladies were like ""*Oh wow, yeah, that sounds like a real 'final straw', little 9-year-old child who is still growing into a person. Thank goodness you're here now!*"" ü§£

That said, this was like...1994/1995 in the midwest, and fatphobia/diet culture was building toward its eventual peak in the early 2000s, so I guess that had a huge impact on what was deemed acceptable. I mean, half the people who went to those meetings ended up taking Fen-Phen, so...it was that kind of world, lol. And the leader probably dgaf because every member, no matter their age, meant she got more membership dues and more chances to sell the crazy amount of WW merch they pushed on people every week. When I was 14 we moved to a new country and my mother tried to re-enroll me in WW there, only to find that they required a doctor's letter for anyone under 18 who wanted to join (and my doctor refused to give her one), so I'm guessing that they eventually cleaned up their act. But wow.

Er...anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to trauma-dump, I kind of went on a nostalgia trip there. The bottom line is that 90s diet culture was wild and WW has a lot to answer for. üòÖ",1743982669.0,2025-04-06T23:37:49+00:00,14,t1_mlroju0,t3_1jsldsq

Even though we are both introverted he has wanted me to do what I call Mandated Socialization. 

I cannot stand Mandated Socialization. So I decided to just grab my panties and suffer though a few times a year. This includes having people over for dinner at our house etc. 

I also have anxiety issues but I am not medicated. I'm doing this raw dog lol

It's hard for me to do but I consider it a necessary duty to keep the peace. I absolutely hate it but I grin and bear it. I make sure i have a lot of downtime after any of these events.

It feels better for now because I have control over what is actionable which is decompression time for myself. He now knows I require it severely so he gives me peace about it.",1754972100.0,2025-08-12T04:15:00+00:00,2,t3_1mnj4p2,t3_1mnj4p2

n89h1hq,queen_debugger,"I could have written this üò¨ It‚Äôs honestly incredibly painful. My partner can make me feel like something is wrong with me even at the rare moments I actually do feel content. Shattering the little sense of self love I have. I explained this to him and he told me he tends to ‚Äòmeasure‚Äô how well i‚Äôm doing based on how much I go out, as that feels more natural to him and also on how i was when I was younger. So he gets worried about me based on those ‚Äòmeasures‚Äô and tries to ‚Äòmotivate‚Äô me to go out. Only he is not great at communication and I am here just being like, why are you mad/grumpy?? :‚Äô) eventually he mentions something about going out, hurting me in the process, while actually he is mostly just worried. He realizes this is an unfair way of going about any of this. But man does it bring a fuckload of tension. 

For actually going out, I realized I cannot be spontaneous anymore and need some time to ramp up to the idea. He knows this and is not ‚Äòallowed‚Äô to be disgruntled when I don‚Äôt want to go to X if he failed to mention it to me in time. He has adhd as well, so this happens ofc sometimes outside of this control. To compensate i try to be somewhat ready to go out (shower regularly, tend to my hair so i dont have to manage my curly hair on the spot, have a set of ‚Äòoutside‚Äô clothes ready in the closet for various weather types) at random points if i feel like it. This way i get less overwhelmed when he (or friends/family) prompts for an outing. 

We also agreed that I am the one that picks the outing. He does not care what he does, mostly he just goes to the city centre and does whatever, going to shops, to bars, sniffing some dopamine. I don‚Äôt like non distinct outings or regular bars like that anymore but I do love going to parties of my preferred music genre. So i make sure those are in my agenda and i plan for them. And plan bigger outings I really actually want to do. E.g we went to a musical and a comedian recently. And i‚Äôll be very vocal about it to show i do like to go out ;p

The bed rotting is still a thing but there is a point for me to just stop care what he thinks. He can be disgruntled but if he is concerned he can use his actual words and ask why or just be supportive and ask how and if he can help in any way. 

As others have said, i am a little concerned about your shares in the household? I do recognize it as well and what helped is to verbally rattle off the things that still needed to be done before i can even think about going out. I have seen him going off and immediately start doing things ;p this was not sustainable tho. He understands but at first he was like ‚Äòget me a chore list‚Äô and i tried but after a while i was like fuck no, you are a grown ass man and i am not your mother. This is your house too i am not making easy lists for you so i can be the one to take all the emotional and thinking load. If you want to unburden me so i/we can be at ease more you will do your part. 

Anyway, im sorry. It sucks. Hugs and hopefully you will figure it out. Being home is great and i really think people that are not even able to be content at their own home have deeper issues that are not our problem ;)",1754992882.0,2025-08-12T10:01:22+00:00,2,t3_1mnj4p2,t3_1mnj4p2

n18sm1w,aslfingerspell,"I found the ""Biggering"" song cut from the Lorax soundtrack to be how addictive and compulsive behaviors feel to me (not just ED but stuff like nailpicking too). The descent into madness, the good intentions warped into evil, the endless quest for self-improvement that leads to self-destruction, the duality of the Oncler and Lorax.

My metaphor is a CEO (conscious brain) hounded by a chairman of the board and stockholders (various feelings good and bad). They can never get enough income/food. They can never cut enough expenses/calories.


Is the CEO really in control, or are they just the fall guy for when the company struggles? Do they fight the corporate excess and cuts, or do they use the greed of the shareholders as an excuse for their worst impulses?



But you really can't blame greed. It's got to worm inside my head, and it's a nasty worm that always needs to feed, and the more I feed it the more hungry it'll get, and it'll never be satisfied.¬†


That worm is called pride. I want to have an awesome body, and after someone took that body away from me I feel like I'm fighting myself to get it back, to life in something I can like.


Until then, the shareholders scream at the CEO. ""We must keep biggering!"", even though¬†biggering is triggering more biggering. When I feel a binge or purge coming on I have to stop it, because biggering will just trigger more biggering.


""I won't stop biggering!"" says the CEO, but is it in agreement or surrender? Triumph or defeat?",1751598627.0,2025-07-04T03:10:27+00:00,3,t3_1lqx0mr,t3_1lqx0mr

My doctor did two stool tests which showed elevated calprotectin (ie; inflammation of the bowel which would suggest crohns or UC). The tests ruled out intolerances and suggested cancer was unlikely.

To also rule out inflammatory disorders, the doc referred me to gastro, but during the examination the doc basically saw no inflammation to her eye. My bussy was frankly beautiful (thank god all those years of letting men ‚Äî yknow what let me shut up there are delicate ears around here) 

She did however say that given I am >! uw and therefore likely not generating enough shit to shit my shit out !< that is likely going to cause bowel issues, alongside any other ED Behaviours I partake in. Often in situations like this, diarrhoea/loose stools is caused by overflow diarrhoea which sounds fucking VILE lol

In your shoes depending on your symptoms I‚Äôd get a stool test first - see if there‚Äôs inflammation, evidence of blood in the stool (could be internal piles, could be an inflammatory disorder, less likely would be something like cancer but the stool test will clarify if there‚Äôs a need to investigate further.

n0kgani,[deleted],"I‚Äôve mostly experienced unstable relationships that left me uncertain and unsupported in my recovery. I often felt incompetent- like I was just guessing my way through healing, with mental health work draining my energy rather than helping me grow. Some of those relationships offered surface-level body confidence, but rarely deeper motivation or security. Lately, dating has felt overwhelming. The early stages are competitive and emotionally volatile- often shaped by unprocessed trauma or paranoia. In the past year and a half, I‚Äôve had painful experiences that left me wounded and less confident. I‚Äôve found myself choosing partners who weren‚Äôt right for me- often rebound situations that ended quickly. It‚Äôs hard to stay open, initiate new connections, or even feel hopeful. I gave more than I received, which left me depleted. I felt more at ease in older relationships, even if they weren‚Äôt right either. I see a scarcity of compatible partners, and I question whether I‚Äôm proactive- or even interested enough. I‚Äôm conflicted about ED spaces. They can offer insight- like a kind of emotional workshopping. I create and delete accounts out of discomfort with leaving a visible trail. Maybe it‚Äôs also because these spaces stir up things I haven‚Äôt fully processed. Isolation only adds to that heaviness.

i've leaned into recoverying for myself. it's stereotypical but it's the truth, and is probably the most reliable way to maintain motivation- even if it's hard in the beginning. i don't have a fully fleshed out reason, just a general understanding that humans need and want food. maybe once i fuel myself enough, i'll find that reason. 

and i know this is a toxic mindset, but i find comfort that i can always go back to restricting. recovery is not a linear journey, nor is it a singular one. maybe ill be recovery and relapsing for the rest of my life, who knows! but im happy right now. i enjoy eating yummy food and i have a hard time caring about what others might think of me (at least for the time being).

myl72sp,ggGo-Next,"For me its not with food, but with water. I made it a habit to purge and ""rinse"" with water. I would purge and then drink water until I was full and throw up then repeat until only bile came out or until I ran out of energy. But now whenever I drink water I will get nauseous. So I cant really drink water and have to stick to some zero cal drinks. Ik putting so much effort and not being skinny is frustrating as hell, but after talking with my doctor the reality is that our metabolisms are just so messed up that your body is basically hoarding calories whenever it gets some bc its in survival mode, which makes it harder to lose weight. I feel you and I know its super hard, but dont lose your fight, keep trying. If you are gone you will not be able to experience so many other things in life. Set smalls goals to what you wanna live for and keep living through the pain for that. I am sorry if I am not of much help, but smt that has at least been working for me for a short time now is doing things like going to a concert or a convention and keep waking up counting down those days and making it to see them happen. Getting a dog also helped me with that aspect of depression, unfortunately not so much with the ED.

muqi37a,bestem,"So I've had gift card transactions ""fail"" like you're talking about on regular registers.  It's unable to authorize the gift card with Blackhawk (our gift card vendor).

They get charged (gift card can't be funded until they're charged) and at the register and in Back Office it will look like it went through, but it will need a manager's override immediately, saying that it failed to authorize.  When they override it, it will print out a special return receipt.  When you scan the barcode on that receipt, it will refund the gift card that failed to activate.  In this particular case, they are then allowed to make another gift card purchase to replace the one that failed to activate (the only time they're able to do multiple gift card transactions in a single day).

That, plus the issue with the self-serve machines, sound like network issues, more than software updates.

Restriction destroys relationships. I will never forget the day I was watching my sister's kids and my nephew (4 or 5 at the time) asked me, ""Auntie Tripthelight, why aren't you eating? You're not hungry?"" It was lunchtime and I just said I had forgotten to make myself a plate and I immediately ate with them.

I never noticed any quieting of the noise for me when I was purging, it always felt like I was empty again so I'd just start over. It's something that I think is easier to do independently as well. Whereas with restriction you can make up a million believable excuses. If you're ""Lucky"" like I am and have friends who just don't notice these things, nobody really picks up on it. These days they just eat and don't even question why I'm not eating. 

The biggest drawback of restriction, socially, is the instant change of mood. I think eating when you restrict is when your ED abuses you the most. Frankly I'm too scared to eat in front of people because I won't be the same person afterwards. I become monosyllabic and I want to hide under a blanket.

I'll bet not. 

I mean, look at how bad you feel about the lying.  If you were a horrible person, it wouldn't bother you at all.  

As far as telling someone goes, I think a lot of people might understand why you would want to hide the truth.  It's just human nature, really.  And we all have a right to be human. 

Also, it's not like you need to wear a big sign around your neck for everyone to see.  It's a personal matter, and not everyone needs to know. 

But it sounds like it would be good if at least one responsible person knew, you know ?

Someone who'd be on your side, and could help you move in the direction you'd rather be going ?

Do you have someone in your life who you trust, and could take that risk with ?

The story was pretty good actually. Both Draco and Hermione are going through some stuff emotionally and career wise, and both developments are realistic. 

There‚Äôs a bit of Romione in the start but it‚Äôs clear that the relationship ran its course (no bashing here).

Comarc is the bad guy (you can see that in the tags, so expect the bashing) and his part touches some sensitive subjects. There‚Äôs mentions of >!sexual assault and harassment at the workplace !< and also a scene with >! mildly explicit violence and SA attempt (not successful) !< . 

The Dramione part is lovely. There‚Äôs obviously the anonymity part and the apartment sharing, Draco exposed to a half magical half muggle environment and learning things. There‚Äôs family struggles and work struggles, and they both lean on each other. 

Overall, I enjoyed the read and like you I‚Äôm also shocked that the author got a lot of hate for it.

mcpmqa6,mygeniuscantdrink,"I have a handful!

One of my faves of all time, [Chef‚Äôs Kiss](https://archiveofourown.org/works/26803423/chapters/65388628) by 5moreminutes (M, 65k) seems cracky based on the premise, but is shockingly tender and full of genuinely very interesting dementor lore! There are plenty of lighthearted elements, but Draco‚Äôs fear and isolation are portrayed very movingly. 

Also [Until the Ink Runs Dry](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30946961/chapters/76428473?style=disable) by AccioMjolnir (T, 41k) is an epistolary fic (with multiple sequels!) which starts out as Hermione writing to Draco as his case worker. I can‚Äôt remember how much of a tearjerker it was, but I remember enjoying it!

And you might enjoy [Fairy Stone](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11208716/1/Fairy-Stone) by Colubrina (M, 13k)? This is one that‚Äôs more concerned with post-Azkaban recovery (though he is in prison for the first part), and I do have it tagged as ""tearjerker"" in my tracker (but - full disclosure - that may have been to do with something brutal another character says to Hermione that literally shocked tears out of me lol).

Two bonus ones which I haven‚Äôt read but are both in my TBR and have rave reviews: [A Gallows Marriage](https://archiveofourown.org/works/56026003/chapters/142295119) by MilaBelle (E, 162k) and [The Gallows](https://archiveofourown.org/works/56119057/chapters/142546828) by gillianeliza (E, 47k). You‚Äôve probably heard of them (or already read them!), but they both concern Hermione marrying Draco out of Azkaban to save him from the dementor‚Äôs kiss - I imagine they are actually quite different in execution despite the similar premise and names (and the fact that both fics started publishing within days of each other). From what I‚Äôve heard, I think The Gallows in particular is very concerned with Draco‚Äôs prison trauma, so might be one to try! (Oh! And another one-shot bonus, if you haven‚Äôt read it, is [your lonely calls to me](https://archiveofourown.org/works/31035770) by senlinyu, illustrated by Avendell - but I don‚Äôt know how much of an itch it will scratch considering it‚Äôs only 3k!)",1739530175.0,2025-02-14T10:49:35+00:00,2,t3_1ip2qub,t3_1ip2qub

Something along those line. Obviously he sprouts a lot of nonsense, so feel free to ignore anything he says. 

In the show Daemon takes his family to live in Essos for ten years. He has no political aspirations whatsoever. We have a scene of him telling Laena how he‚Äôs glad to be free of the politics of Westeros. It‚Äôs Laena that‚Äôs berating Daemon for his lack of ambition. 

With regards to Laena, she witnessed him being accused of killing his wife. She later offered her condolences to Daemon for his loss. Daemon said something like don‚Äôt be, the lady was never very kind to me. With Laena pursuing Daemon in the show it could certainly be argued that she was using him. She was betrothed to the sea lord of Bravos son, who Daemon challenged and killed in single combat. It‚Äôs Laena who goes on n about wanting to die a dragon rider death. Laena not some innocent victim that people need to feel sorry for. She saw a better option and went after it.

l0skx4s,[deleted],"In the show, it's really hard to tell, because we essentially skip over all of their courtship and any honeymoon phase.¬†


Both probably had reason to pursue the other, other than feelings for the other (if that makes sense); Daemon had his feelings over Rhaenyra and over Viserys as well as his political position and long alliance with the Velaryons. Laena's father was in conversation with the Braavosi for her hand, she could have seen Daemon as the better choice.¬†


But, there's definite affection there. There's no suggestion of nefarious or cruel motives on either side for the marriage. When we meet them, ten years in, Laena may feel trapped in her life but she still questions Daemon and stands up to him, however fruitless. Daemon cares for her state, doesn't patronise her, is fairly honest with her. There's no sense of an extraordinary power imbalance other than what society already gives them.


However it is clear that his wishes come first. And it's clearly framed that, whatever the emotions, it's not the IDEAL, because the ideal is Daemon and Rhaenyra. They are framed as the ""true"" love. As something meant to be and as something to be hoped for by the audience. By doing that, you instantly put down the relationship Daemon has with Laena.¬†


I think we just meet them when passion has cooled and where their wishes diverge. He wants one thing. She wants another.¬†

l0v1325,CuteProtection6,"> I think he used Laena for his own political gain

i would respectfully disagree with this. i think in daemon's eyes, laena was an obvious choice for him after learning of rhaenyra's betrothal to laenor. aligning himself also with the velaryons would not only strengthen rhaenyra's hand and by extension of that, the crown, but it would also keep her close - as it was known that laenor and laena were extremely attached to one another and would want to continue to remain in each other's lives even after marriage. in the books, the 4 of them regularly meet and they share their married lives. this would (imo) have been a conscious play by daemon to ensure he could remain close to rhaenyra. 

of course, the show deviates from this and presents an alternative story, which isn't necessarily bad, just different. 

with that said, i think daemon cared for laena because she enabled him to fulfil his motives (staying close to rhaenyra). i think he enjoyed her valyrian ancestry, and certainly being related to her probably helped a lot LOL. but love? i don't think so.",1713860747.0,2024-04-23T08:25:47+00:00,4,t3_1cal4be,t3_1cal4be

I thought about this alot with Viserys and Alicent‚Ä¶I have a friend who thinks Viserys chose Alicent because she was like a comforting person who didn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúulterior motive,‚Äù but I strongly disagree with that because Alicent wouldn‚Äôt even have been around the king at all had it not been continued pressure from Hightower to engage with him, and then of course nudge Viserys towards decisions that Hightower wanted.

proclivities, and has a massive dragon. 

In the show, their relationship is only touched on very briefly in episode 6. It seems to be having a midlife crisis and is bored with his uneventful status not bored with her. He was upset when she died so I suppose he loved her.

House Velaryon could have swayed the war in the Green's favor if only they could have gotten their hands on Baela. Marrying Baela (a dragon rider) to Aegon removes all things Velaryon, Rhaenys and Daemon. Rhaenyra would be screwed.

l0w2dhx,ladykaede_,"Yes...'we were happy enough' is a very revealing statement. Also revealing is Daemon's reply to Rhaenyra's comment about her life becoming a droll tragedy without him: 'And I wonder what you think of mine by comparison?'. He's saying that his life without Rhaenyra was no better than hers without him. Everything else being equal, if he had been in love with Laena, it's hard to imagine he would say that. 

Ryan Condal said of Daemon and Laena in the official companion book that 'It's a good thing, their relationship, but he never is quite as in love with her as he would like to believe, or as she would like him to be.' To me that matches up with what we see onscreen - he cares for her, respects her, they have a rapport and have made what appears to be a good life together (though it's running into issues by the time we catch up with them). But there is a sense from Laena that she wants more than she's getting/gotten from him, even though she assures him she's okay with being Choice #2. What woman, especially a woman like Laena, would actually be fine with that (or pretend to be fine with it) unless she's the one in the relationship who loves more? She pursued him and she got him - but didn't get as much of him, it seems, as she hoped.",1713880849.0,2024-04-23T14:00:49+00:00,7,t1_l0v4cjl,t3_1cal4be

Six months from what I'm getting but it's not something you can't bypass with the right excuse or the right amount of power.

Aegon's marriage wasnt even because she's a traitor or anything.¬†His 1st wife was a noncombantant and a non-threat, hell she was married to him to avoid conflict, not spark it, and the Black allied lords were fine with it. And his 2nd wife wasnt a needed alliance, it was just a thing that happened.

As for Rhaenyra, it states that Laena, Laenor & Harwin all died in earlier 120, Aegon III was born at the very end of 120, with 8-9 months of pregnancy needed, that means they married anywhere from 1-2 months most like from the days, if we are assuming she didn't marry because she was already pregnant",1713834423.0,2024-04-23T01:07:03+00:00,1,t1_l0tkyeg,t3_1cal4be

If you're asking me, I think they married about 5 months after Laena died but Rhaenyra was already a few months pregnant. Mushroom claims that this was the case and while he's not that reliable, pregnancy math isn't hard to do. There's a rumour that Daemon had Laenor killed and considering that Laenor is their ally, the only good reason I see for Daemon doing that is if Rhaenyra is pregnant and he knows about it. He would want to claim the kid, he's not the Harwin type that would just sit on the side and watch his kid call another man father.¬†

Hell from what we know he never even went to Harrenhal, he lived in KL.

Also Laenor's death was 100% not an accident. Qarl and him got into a heated fight in a Spicetown market square & Qarl stabbed him. Corlys put a bounty on him but they never found Qarl. I think its very likely Rhaenyra and/or Daemon paid him to do it and then killed and fed the body to a dragon.

[**Antinomian**](https://archiveofourown.org/works/49319863/chapters/124452640) by thestarsoforion (rated explicit)

It starts off in 4th year with Draco revealing his feelings for Hermione to the person of interest herself. The latest chapter is compliant with >!the beginning of DH if the timeline matters.!<

Summary:
>He's always watched her. He can't help it. Merlin help him, he's been fucking trying though.

>She hates him. He's a vile, bigoted arsehole. Of all the people who have made her feel small, who have made her have to fight and scrape and claw for her place in this world ever since she was eleven, he's the worst of them all.

>But when things take a turn at the Yule Ball, Draco Malfoy decides he's done fighting himself, and Hermione Granger is left floored, struggling to understand this new, strange version of him.

[**Truth or Dare**](https://archiveofourown.org/works/51244390/chapters/129483703) by januarydevine (rated explicit).

The summary is lengthy, but Hermione has a stalker and Draco is hired to protect her. The forced proximity also encourages Hermione's own obsession with Draco (who is already obsessed with her).

[**Hogwarts: a Home**](https://archiveofourown.org/works/32116096/chapters/79565590) by coralcollective (rated explicit)

Summary:
>The horcrux hunt: reimagined
>
>What if Dumbledore never got the chance to tell Harry about the horcruxes?
>
>The Order has established Hogwarts as a sanctuary from Voldemort's reign of terror over the European Wizarding World. It's up to the next generation of The Order of the Phoenix to figure out how to destroy Voldemort with unlikely friendships and unexpected love.

n7f0g97,Peepoodine,"I feel you so bad... I'm 31, and I'm currently back to this exact same situation. I should admit that with time and therapy, I ended up by understanding a bit more about bpd, I now have a lot of tools to temper the symptoms,  I know when I have to be carefull about my vulnerability,  I know how to assume and say it...

But now, after trying again and again, half studies, some succeeded, jobs... I burned myself again, and just like you, I'm watching my life running out, right under my nose. And I spend the day watching at the ceiling, waiting for the day to end.

I won't have a super cheerful answer here, but at least you'll may be feel a bit less alone. That's unfair, and it makes no sens to go through that...
But I guess that we are condamned to find a rigorous health mechanisms, to deal better with daily challenges, and find the right pace that correspond to our limits and needs, and know how to respect it. Accept it, and yeah again, respect our own limits.

For my part, I'm now trying to reconnect socially thanks to an organization that connect people suffering from mental pain and stuff... kind of AA for mental health issues. And I use that first step as a pretext to train, to win back a bit more mobility from this mental and emotional paralysis. I'm trying to listen to my triggers and respect my pace in what I'm engaging into that group. I know it's temporary.

Find your first step. It's temporary too, I swear ‚ù§Ô∏è
It can be through sublimation, express through sport or art, all of your feelings, but I know it's easier to say. That's only theory. I wouldn't be able as well today, so that's why, meeting people in the same situation, helps to stop the self focus and decentralized from your inner world.

mvdgkji,valkrycp,"Hi there, I really love this piece and would like to know more about what it means to you. I think there's some pretty clear motifs, but they are mostly working on a layer-by-layer basis rather than as a complete whole. I don't mean that in their aesthetic- they're beautifully designed. The Matrioshka nesting dolls obviously reveal inner layers about their hosts- what appears to be your ""spirit animals"" or chinese new year birth animal in one layer, the inner-most layer being reddit emojis. But I'm not entirely sure how to read the entirety with all of the pieces together if I didn't have the info that you met on reddit- like many audiences may not know. I struggle a bit to piece together a narrative cohesively without that info, but I don't think that hampers it's successes especially if this piece is mostly for yourself not others. But I think it is a very interesting piece so regardless of whether I understand, I understand enough of it's universal themes to make my own story and to enjoy the piece. But personally as a fellow artist, I'm interested in hearing your interpretation and intent.

Now having typed this all out and looked at the piece longer, the ""opposites"" or ""complementary"" theme going on stands out pretty strongly. The hearts, the sun/moon or light/dark, the tiger and fish symbolism, rain + lightning. I am assuming the reddit profiles are life / death or your actual profile pics? But I think the reddit part gives leaves me a little more confused than the other two layers.

Beautiful piece. I would love a similar one for myself and gf- we met on WoW before dating online was normal, but I unfortunately can't afford to commission. But take that as a complement! I think it maybe feels a little bit ""floaty"" in that small pink background and small piece of paper. My suggestion for next time would maybe be to bring some of those elements out of the dolls and into the space around them. Ground the dolls in a space of some kind, even if it's still abstract. Like maybe clouds floating around the top, or rain in the background, or butterflies flying around in the foreground and background.",1748758962.0,2025-06-01T06:22:42+00:00,8,t3_1l0hk0r,t3_1l0hk0r

mvdt1zr,LaaaaMaaaa,"Thank you for such a detailed response. I love these really shows how much people feel my work ü•∞ü©∑


Main idea behind it all was to show our three years together and growth. As you can see the Russian dolls are getting bigger but also merging together (thanks to love - heart symbol binding us closer together with time)

I had to start out with our Reddit avatars because we met on Reddit
I gave my bf lighting because his past was geared towards aggression and fights (he‚Äôs a very combative person) and me tears because sadness and depression was my past. We both helped each other a lot to not fully get over but tame these sides of us
(I actually love lighting/rain comparison it wasn‚Äôt intended but I love it!)
We both used to self harm which was our first connection so I added faded red from top. Blood we spilled

Next dolls are salmon and a tiger 
His name is Salman so I tend to portray him this way. Sockeye salmon because they both have a cute big nose. 
I‚Äôm a tiger because of my self harm scars
It has some more personal symbolism for me regarding our second year but it‚Äôs too much to explain 

Lastly is moon and the starts and the sun. 
Me and my parents used to watch Game of Thrones. They started calling each other sun and moon and the starts for a bit since it was the names of Khal Drogo and Khaleesi. I found it to be extremely romantic
Salman doesn‚Äôt like origin story of that (my father was a piece of shit) but I do so I decided I can at least add it in my work
I also liked how my first and last Russian doll both have drop shape motif but meaning is reversed 


As you can see it‚Äôs deeply personal. Just for me and him. I don‚Äôt mind that it‚Äôs not obvious to others - that‚Äôs kind of the point. But once I finished I was like ‚Äúoh boi that‚Äôs a lot of different colors üò≥‚Äù So I was wondering it that mix doesn‚Äôt look like unicorn puke

I agree that setting it in 3D space could be way better

Myers-Briggs would later add to that. She wrote:

n5faxys,Your___mom_,"I'm usually open minded when it comes to MBTI, but this crosses a line.


Think of it logically, for ENTPs to like the particular smell, they need to A) Touch grass, and B) Have the ability to smell.


Since ENTPs are Nx-doms, they lack both A and B. The natural habitat of the ENTP is usually the basement, or another dark and secluded vicinity. However, unlike us Ni-doms, Ne-doms usually open their windows in order to seek inspiration from the light of the sun, as the warmth of the particular star is a nice contrast to ENTP's dark and cold ""soul"", and Ne-doms love contrast.


I hope this helped, and remember to stop posting misinformation on this subreddit.¬†

n2c63k1,umamirat,"I dont know if its the right place to comment but my mum caught me doing something really really bad to my body in a similar situation like yours almost a decade ago. It may be cynical to say it or think this way but people are too discreet and probably wont be mentioned because nowadays there's so much stigma and at the same time it seems like almost everyone and their mothers have EDs (especially the mothers). So to me the possible outcomes are: a) he wont mention it cause he thinks its normal for a young person to have an ED and its too normalised, b) he will worry but will think its none of his business, maybe telling your bf because he thinks he will handle the conversation better or c) he will ask you about it and honestly I see it as him worrying and caring for you. Maybe the thought of you having an ED didnt even cross his mind and he thinks you were having an upset stomach as anyone could be. But I honestly understand your feeling of shame it's something so vulnerable and raw and personal that nobody would want someone to witness, especially a figure of authority or a fatherly presence in your life. Remember to take care and be ready to not lash out or be defensive -if there IS a conversation, it will be out of concern and love, not control or pity.
EDIT: changed ""actually sick"" to ""having an upset stomach"" since i didnt realise the connotations it could have til I posted. English is not my first language and I didnt mean ""actually sick"" as in underestimating ED-related behaviours but as in sick as anyone could be.",1752142333.0,2025-07-10T10:12:13+00:00,7,t3_1lw3q1p,t3_1lw3q1p

n26mk8m,despondent-salmon,"Well SA is hard to deal with thru healthy coping mechanisms. To hazard a guess (aka I just pulled this out of my ass) as to why EDs in particular, maybe because EDd are not just a coping mechanism but are specifically tied to trying to alter and control the body.

SA, in the loss of bodily autonomy, can be seen as lack of ability to control one's body. So maybe the ED feels like a way to take back that control that was lost, and specifically control over the body. Additionally, there is an idea that the body can be made to be ""unattractive"" / gross / repulsive, and that this can be protective against further assaults. Finally it can be a form of punishment. Speaking on a personal level, I see it like this -- my body betrayed me and caused me so much pain, and so now I will cause IT pain back. It doesn't really make sense, that im punishing myself even when I know it wasn't my fault, but it *feels* like my fault still.

Bro claimed I was faking my ED when I had been caught multiple times by multiple nurses doing ED things AND he'd been told by general hospital (doctors and a dietician) that I had an ED and urgently needed treatment. He called a meeting with the ward manager and my mum, they told me off for 'faking' it, threw the meal plan in the bin and told me to come back when I was fucking underweight. Not that it even matters in general but in this context I was literally on the borderline between healthy and UW so technically I should've been 'sick enough' for his messed up standards.

So I'd start with that. Otherwise most unis will have jobs you can do around uni that you can fit around your schedule like ambassador shifts which you usually do on weekends, I'd recommend that over a bar shift because the 9am lectures are killer (or they are if you're a night owl like me). 

If you did get cut off and you're really struggling you can also apply for a hardship grant with Pharmacist Support, they cover students as well as qualified pharmacists. https://pharmacistsupport.org/support-for-students/


Also, once you're a student you get free membership of the PDA  (you still have to register but it's worth doing because once you qualify it gets expensiveeee) and they have a really lovely LGBT network you can join, the whatsapp group is mostly full of qualified pharmacists but they're very friendly so it's useful for like, if you want to know anywhere in your area that might be hiring, someone there will probably know. 

Pharmacy is hard even when you've got supportive family, but if you reach out to the uni now and maybe some local pharmacies (independents will be better than chains) and try and get an idea of what's available you won't be trying to scramble around as much researching it while also absorbing all the info you get thrown at you in the first few weeks.",1754784098.0,2025-08-10T00:01:38+00:00,1,t3_1mlbesg,t3_1mlbesg

lokd9oy,Several_Puffins,"I did a load of research on this because I don't share the sub's general view that it's okay to keep a last lone rat. My research looked at experimental papers that examine depressive and anxious behaviours in isolated lab rats (I found one that covered human handling as a controlled variable).

So the good news is, your company really does help. Lone rats with human play are better than lone rats without. Rats who have a lot of human contact AND a lot of rat contact are better off that rats who only socialise with rats!

The bad news is, if you have to choose, you should choose rats for company. Conspecifics are more beneficial to rat mental health.

Of course, it depends on how frail frail is- I wouldn't re-home a rat who couldn't keep on the weight, or who had inoperable tumours, or something else of that kind, but I absolutely would re-home a rat with, say, some slight back leg paralysis. I did, with my last girl, when she was two years six months. She lived a happy life in her new home and made it to three years two months. I couldn't possibly have given her that and am a bit horrified at the idea of her living another 8 months without rats to keep her company (though she probably wouldn't have lived that long alone).

Yes, Introductions can be stressful, but not as stressful as people make out when discussing  this topic. In my experience old rats often sidestep any dominance fighting anyway- they're not part of the politics any more. Not always, and each case is different, but I would only keep a last rat if I was sure they were on their way out.",1727116349.0,2024-09-23T18:32:29+00:00,1,t3_1fnp71q,t3_1fnp71q

lnernvm,[deleted],"As someone who used to be a cleaner I genuenly think she doesn't care about the dirt. I was always terrified of getting infected, and remembered a true story about a very professional colleague who avoided huge viral infection alone due to wearing all of their available gear professionally. For me not touching the dirt directly was natural reaction, and I avoided direct skincontact all the times to stay safe and healthy.

There have been multiple videos where Auri ditches her gloves near the end of cleaning when wiping some surfaces, or where she doesn't wear a basic face masks. And I'll squerm myself thinking sure she didn't directly touch the dirt but she was so close. I truly think she isn't scared of all the shit she touches, that might even be the reason she can go to these apartments. She simply doesn't worry about it I think. Most of us would make an u-turn at crack house,  and just silently think the place should be burned.

Personally I would wear honestly thick rubber boots AND disposable shoe covers. For the head face mask at minimum, and my hair would be in tight bun, most likely covered as well. Outfit wise I would wear disposable aprons, professional clothes that I would wash at industrial cleaning machine at 90 degrees, and double layer of protective gloves. Toolwise I have to agree with Auri, no point of bringing vacoom cleaners of any sort in to these buildings. You have to be able to clean and disinfect absolutely everything you bring in to these landfills, or prepare to burn them afterwards.

I do think her gear and style suit the average Finnish hoarder house with ton of dry trashes and sort of livable conditions. But I personally would be paranoid of getting some awful disease or long term illness from these apartments, especially from the truly bad ones. And while she likes dirt and clearly doesn't look at it with fear and disgust like most of us do, she should be more informed about the illnesses she will eventually get.",1726495175.0,2024-09-16T13:59:35+00:00,5,t1_lnei1ze,t3_1fi1nrn

Testavan has supposedly higher bioavailability than other gels, and at least in my own experience it gave me *way* higher levels than Testogel gave me at the same dosage (2.5 pumps of Testavan or \~57.5mg, vs 50mg Testogel), so it might be that the dose with Testavan is too high and it's converting back to estrogen.

jm81j6x,Alaira314,"Using an early-00s template for how the characters would have been conceived of? A fair number of them would have been, correlating with age(though there'd be some notable exceptions, of course). Teens would be more likely to be supportive/openly queer themselves, whereas you'd see more open hate and closeted queerness in older generations. Yes, the closet would be a *major* player, here. Malicious outings would be a threat, and the general population wouldn't automatically think the person doing the outing was the asshole of the situation, especially if the outed person ""deserved it"". A significant portion of the male population would be very excited about lesbians, even as they're grossed out(or act grossed out) by gay men. Many men, especially young men(teen, ya, early adult) would by very preoccupied with making sure everybody knows they're not gay. There'd also be a lot of *misguided* support that's actually pretty homophobic, think self-proclaimed "">!fag!< hags"" and so on(yes this still happens, but it was much bigger and less condemned back in the day).

The Summerdream clan in Veronaville would probably be the big exception. They wouldn't understand what all the fuss was about.

jm7ikht,[deleted],"The Goths, depending on the generation. I think Mortimer would definitely be homophobic. Cassandra would be uncomfortable with it at first, but would eventually come around. I feel like Alexander would be very accepting.

In Veronaville, I feel like it would also depend on the generation. The elders are definitely homophobic. As for the adults, I feel like Kent, Bianca and the Summerdreams would be accepting, but the others would not. The teens are all accepting, but Tybalt and Mercutio have a bit more nuance to them. In my hood, they're both bi, so I see them as having a lot of internalized homophobia that they need to work through (I'm actually trying to get them to fall in love with each other, but I don't know if I'll succeed).

jm86pdv,FriendshipNo1440,"I just know pleasantview abd strangetown

In Pleasantview

Mortimer Goth might have a hard time to understand it, but if a close one would turn out gay I think he would be suportive

Mary Sue might have a bigger problem with it. She seems like not that open minded to me, because how she handels Lillith.

Daniel would just be like... ""Yes u are gay, and?""

The Oldies would handle it a bit like Mortimer, but they are more down to earth so I think they will accept homosexuals.

The Caliante Sister also would not care I suppose. And Don only cares because he knows if he has a chance with a woman (considering he is straight).

All the other adults seem more caring and open about it.

The only teen sim who I could see bully others is Dustin, but only if none of hus close ones is gay. If either Beau or Baby broke are gay I think he would act like a proper big bro and protect them.

---

In Strangetown I can def see either complete acceptence to complele hate.

Buzz, Olive and the Beakers all give me homophobic vibes for different reasons.

Buzz is like they typical patriot who thinks that one should be proud to be (whatever country you think Sims plays in)

Olive is an old hag who just cares about herself. She seems to live in the past tho by constantly killing sims just to see her love.

And the Beakers would be the conspiracy tinfold people who think the earth is flat and homosexuality is an illness and all this.

The only middle ground Sim seems to be Ayjay. He just does not give it a thought or cares.

Everyone else is pretty much open about it. I mean the rest is all related to Aliens or trated badly and they know how it is to be a minor or opressed.",1685467615.0,2023-05-30T17:26:55+00:00,2,t3_13vp9hq,t3_13vp9hq

In a funny way kind of opposite to your situation, my rats have honestly been helping me use and eat more veggies/fruit. I have sensory issues that make it difficult for me to eat them a lot, and sometimes it's hard for me to motivate myself to eat them at all, so getting stuff for the rats is a good excuse for me to have a bit too. 

I remember reading a little bit from a book about making customized feed mixes for rats about how much enjoyment they get out of trying different foods. Making a custom blend for their regular food is a bit beyond me - they'll be sticking to Oxbow as their regular diet - but getting to give them different kinds of treats and seeing them react is such a fun part of keeping rats.",1656944423.0,2022-07-04T14:20:23+00:00,32,t3_vr77lj,t3_vr77lj

hsnmca0,FurtiveCutless,"Oh hey, I have the same cage.

I don't think it's the perspective: the ladder at the bottom is pretty useless. Way too steep and they almost certainly can't climb that (I know they'll climb the cage but you may as well remove that thing)

More stuff in general would be a good idea. For example you could add something in the middle of the cage, roughly at the height of the second platform to break any potential fall. Right now your ratties could drop all the way from the top to the bottom in that area, which could cause injury (unlikely if my girls are anything to go by but better safe than sorry)

Another thing I like is using ropes as alternate pathways and for climbing. You can get them in pretty much all pet stores in the section for birds. They attach just fine to the cage and have thick wire in the middle, allowing you to bend them into pretty much any shape. 

And finally, more hides and houses. Cheap wooden houses are bad because they really soak up the pee.",1642182724.0,2022-01-14T17:52:04+00:00,2,t3_s3xsfo,t3_s3xsfo

hni5vke,SprinklesTheRat,"Sounds like dominance grooming. They're putting the babies in their place and teaching them some manners. ;) Babies think everything's a game, and need to learn that when the older rats say play time is over, *play time is over.* The more the babies refuse to sit still, scream, and bounce around, the longer it takes. My older girls do this to all new babies. No one ever gets hurt, just teaches the youngsters to behave themselves and that there are bigger rats they need to respect. As long as there's no blood, it's all good. They have to sort out their hierarchy and figure out what everyone's about. 

With my girls, during the first month they're all together they'll have small squabbles filled with a lot of intense grooming, and then after the first month they're all good buds who hardly make a sound. It'll usually sound worse than it is.",1638823059.0,2021-12-06T20:37:39+00:00,3,t3_rag5ya,t3_rag5ya

I was gonna leave them in the smaller cage for a couple of days but it was going so well that I cleaned out the critter nation and put them in there with nothing but bedding and the litter boxes.

hicbwhr,RelevantMode,"there are several ways to this.

i prefer to just give them more time.  
basically talk to them nicely, interact at least 1-2h daily, bribe with treats, and dont force them.  
seeing you interact with the other rat (and it not being scared) will also show that its safe to trust you.

that might take a lot longer than the other way, but it works too.

usually all a matter of time, and persistent interacting with them.  
and its totally ok that it might take a few weeks for some to start trusting you, thats not uncommon.  
ideally you get them to understand that its always safe to take a treat from you, then it¬¥ll get a lot easier ;)  
(the first step is always the hardest. the more they trust you, the easier it will be to make progress)

careful with peanut butter, due its consistency it can be a choking hazard.

for all new rat owners can totally recommend [http://www.isamurats.co.uk/](http://www.isamurats.co.uk/), its a great all-around rat care guide that covers almost anything.

Of course you're not a shitty person. Of course you're not a let down. I'm so proud of you that you've been trying so hard to make your life better, even if you couldn't do some of things you thought you should. Mental health can be overwhelming.

Have you contacted your professor to let her/him know what is going on and to see how you can catch up? As a professor, I can tell you that most of us want to know, most of us want to help. If you have a diagnosis, also consider contacting your school's disability services as there are often accommodations that can be made. If you're not seeing a counselor, now might be a good time to start. A lot of colleges provide these services for free on campus.

Whatever you decide, you can do this. You are strong and brave and worthy. You are not alone.

mysjo21,LivingZesty,"To be blunt, your situation is not complicated. Your eating disorder is ruining your health, and probably consuming the rest of your life. You know this, but you haven‚Äôt found the strength to fight through the discomfort of change yet. 

You will not see any progress until you gain weight and address your disordered behaviors. It‚Äôs messing up your hormones, your nutrient intake, and honestly it‚Äôs probably why you can‚Äôt poop. Supplementation is like pissing on a fire at this point.  

You are 19. The bad news is that it sounds like you have suffered from anorexia throughout your teens, so you have lost pivotal developmental years to the disorder. The good news is you are still young, and you still have time to turn things around. If you act NOW and gain weight, incorporate strength training, and explore bone building options with your doctor, you can completely change your physical outlook.

Trust me when I say I know how difficult it can be to change. But your entire attitude seems so defeatist, like you have turned your eating disorder into an integral part of your life. Don‚Äôt accept it. If you do, you will always regret this moment when you didn‚Äôt change. 

Sorry for the tough love, but you already know what the solution is. You have a severe mental illness, and you either need to get help or push through it yourself.",1750418178.0,2025-06-20T11:16:18+00:00,15,t3_1lfx4om,t3_1lfx4om

I wish I had any real advice. Anorexia sounds like a very hard thing to deal with. Know that it can be overcome, and that due to your youth you still have time to build bone, but you‚Äôll need to find a way to overcome it and get good nutrition.

My spine number improved.  It also is a source of protein.  Yogurt if you can tolerate it would be good for gut health.  But overall you are going to need to eat more and lift heavy weights. Read the book Great Bones by Keith McCormick he lists a lot of supplements for bone health.,1750421035.0,2025-06-20T12:03:55+00:00,3,t3_1lfx4om,t3_1lfx4om

mz0qk4u,cropcomb2,"> I know the obvious solution to my problem is to gain weight, 

That's skipping the GIGANTIC step of your first needing to learn not to self-sabotage.  

Habits can be very hard to drop, but they're often easier to replace with something else.  Perhaps find some other interest to obsess over to replace your complusions to lose weight/avoid food.

Dairy's great (problem with cheese, too?), but, so long as you're getting enough vit. D (eg. 600-800+ i.u./day and your blood levels confirm you've reached a normal or high normal level of vit. D), calcium supplements will suffice (I see 600=900 mg/day total calcium as safe, a bit each time you eat).  A bone friendly diet is also seen to include 5 or more servings of varied veggies and fruits per day.

All the other patches have secondary value, but there is no way out of a decision and commitment to shift this avting out.  I truly identify.  When the brain gets rewired onto soothing, and seeking control through restriction, its powerfully motivated to retain that pattern.

mpzaa1j,Solal-King-Raccoon,I was one of these teens. I constantly felt the need to post pics of my sick body and my parents didn‚Äôt know I had this account. I got to an emaciated BMI but my parents were living in some kind of defeat and I‚Äôd been so awful to them they stopped insisting for me to eat. So I was just getting worse while they worried sick but stopped actually trying to help. It was like living in a house with strangers. We didn‚Äôt talk much. Eventually they agreed when the hospital sectioned me. But I don‚Äôt blame them for my ED getting worse nor for ‚Äúletting me‚Äù have my blue bird account. They simply didn‚Äôt know. I got social media really late compared to most people (around 16yrs old) and my ED was already full blown before I fell on the app. I don‚Äôt think my parents could have done anything better to ‚Äúsave me‚Äù I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve mattered,1746082512.0,2025-05-01T06:55:12+00:00,31,t3_1kby7dv,t3_1kby7dv

mpykzht,Glittering_Big_4530,"It's absolutely sickening. A child, mentally healthy or not should not be given free reign, unchecked phone access 247. Add a diagnosis of severe anorexia, those parents should be doing better. They might not be allowed to go to school considering their disease, or for as long, but surely that makes it easier to regulate what they're consuming and putting out. Unrelated but I really don't think children should be allowed on social media. But it disturbs me that there will be fetishists trying to talk to them, or trying to get even more from them. Eating disordered adults face it enough. Imagine a developing but malnourished mind. It would be too easy. Disgusting. 

Forced recovery is difficult the older they get but a responsible adult should give their child a fighting chance by regulating what they can access. If they can't access that stuff and it continues to get worse then they need to explore different options, but keeping on doing the same thing is destructive and inexcusable.",1746069951.0,2025-05-01T03:25:51+00:00,23,t3_1kby7dv,t3_1kby7dv

moj3veh,Lindsey7618,"So I understand your worry, I really do. But removing scales and forbidding use is seriously not an effective way to manage that worry. I know your parents did that because of your ED and that's fine, but not allowing your sister to use one when she doesn't have an ED is more likely to lead to her using one and being sneaky about it just because they refused to let her use one. 

Nobody can force someone to not worry about their weight. She's a teenager, she'll worry about it because most teens do. That's natural. Going overboard with the rules isn't going to ensure her safety like they want and is more likely to contribute to risk of an ED imo.

At the end of the day, your parents should have taught your sister about EDs, about being healthy and being safe with her health and weight, and should NOT be painting scales and weight loss as bad. Because the reality is that it isn't. It's bad for those of us who have EDs and use those things to control our weight and destroy our bodies, but healthy, non disordered people are allowed to use scales and think about their weight. It doesn't have to turn into something disordered. Banning things in the house will only increase curiosity. 

If your sister was obese, would you have the sane worry? Would your parents think am obese daughter shouldn't worry about her weight or look at what the scale says? I'm just trying to make the point that there isn't anything wrong with anyone wanting to know or keep track of their weight. That's actually normal and healthy. What's not normal and healthy is when you obsess over the scale, weigh yourself daily, restrict food, etc. Is your sister doing that? If she isn't doing things that are actually unhealthy, she isn't doing anything wrong. 

I would be more worried about pressure from her being in sports, so I don't blame you for being worried to be clear! I just see both sides. If you're not living at home, I think banning scales in the house is going overboard. You can't treat your child like glass because your other child had an ED. She's a separate person.

moj3x4x,Lindsey7618,"So I understand your worry, I really do. But removing scales and forbidding use is seriously not an effective way to manage that worry. I know your parents did that because of your ED and that's fine, but not allowing your sister to use one when she doesn't have an ED is more likely to lead to her using one and being sneaky about it just because they refused to let her use one. 

Nobody can force someone to not worry about their weight. She's a teenager, she'll worry about it because most teens do. That's natural. Going overboard with the rules isn't going to ensure her safety like they want and is more likely to contribute to risk of an ED imo.

At the end of the day, your parents should have taught your sister about EDs, about being healthy and being safe with her health and weight, and should NOT be painting scales and weight loss as bad. Because the reality is that it isn't. It's bad for those of us who have EDs and use those things to control our weight and destroy our bodies, but healthy, non disordered people are allowed to use scales and think about their weight. It doesn't have to turn into something disordered. Banning things in the house will only increase curiosity. 

If your sister was obese, would you have the sane worry? Would your parents think am obese daughter shouldn't worry about her weight or look at what the scale says? I'm just trying to make the point that there isn't anything wrong with anyone wanting to know or keep track of their weight. That's actually normal and healthy. What's not normal and healthy is when you obsess over the scale, weigh yourself daily, restrict food, etc. Is your sister doing that? If she isn't doing things that are actually unhealthy, she isn't doing anything wrong. 

I would be more worried about pressure from her being in sports, so I don't blame you for being worried to be clear! I just see both sides. If you're not living at home, I think banning scales in the house is going overboard. You can't treat your child like glass because your other child had an ED. She's a separate person. Healthy discussions around the topic would be a more appropriate way to manage any worry imo. It's okay for your sister to be health conscious and to monitor her weight and food and macros. Healthy people are supposed to do that.

1) only got the fun head rush for the first week then felt nothing

2) it won‚Äôt help you shit if you‚Äôre not consuming proper nutrients

3) I spend approximately $1000+ a year on nicotine. I don‚Äôt even want to think about what I could‚Äôve done with that money.

4) it‚Äôs embarrassing. Truly. Vaping is not cool, idk why people think it‚Äôs the 1900‚Äôs. It hasn‚Äôt been cool since tobacco has been proven to cause cancer. I feel ashamed of myself every single time I hit my vape. 

5) never had health anxiety before I started vaping, my panic attacks make me think my nicotine habit is the end times for me. Everytime I can‚Äôt breathe well, everytime my heart feels weird, I think about the fact that I vape and that it is killing me. 

6) I‚Äôve tried to quit 3x. Went into severe depressive episodes every time and it made me mean. Continued vaping because i decided I‚Äôd rather off myself than go through withdrawal. 

7) I‚Äôm an adult, but I‚Äôm so embarrassed that I lie to friends and family so they don‚Äôt think I have a nicotine addiction. Only close friends know. It‚Äôs exhausting to hide it. As if eating disorder habits weren‚Äôt enough.

8) life insurance when you‚Äôre older? Forget it. If you vape enough, you‚Äôll be denied swiftly. They will automatically assume you don‚Äôt care about your health or future.



Literally any other method to shit would be better than a nicotine addiction tbh. I‚Äôm considering medication so I am able to quit. But quitting again feels hopeless and anxiety provoking.

mockxh3,beomint,"It's not that vaping or nicotine automatically makes you poop, it's that it fucks with your body so badly you can have bowel changes from it, and one of those changes some people get is gut inflammation that can lead to really severe gastrointestinal symptoms like gas, bloating, cramps, and diarrhea. It's also not a 1 hit = 1 shit type deal, it's people who regularly partake in nicotine that might experience long term bowel issues on top of all the other lovely long term issues and symptoms you get from smoking/vaping/using nicotine at all.

The problem with getting into any form of nicotine, ESPECIALLY for people with EDs, is you're literally setting yourself up to lose the game you're trying to play with it. What you want from nicotine only comes from frequent use, and very rarely do people get away with using nicotine for life without any problems. If you become addicted or even worse begin to rely on it to fuel your ED, you will likely begin to face serious health complications that will eventually force you to consider breaking the addiction. And when that happens, ALL of the issues you were trying to cover up with nicotine will come rushing back all at once ten times over.

At the end of the day, you're gonna do what you want to do with yourself and please don't let the ramblings of some ED bitches on Reddit make you feel like we're trying to tell you how to live your life as that is always going to be your choice, not ours. All we can do is offer information and first hand experience on what we've gone through and I can tell you first-hand, nicotine did nothing for me except set me back and while I still struggle with addiction to other things today, I would never put myself back on that addiction for ANYTHING and I'm happy it's no longer something I rely on.",1745281346.0,2025-04-22T00:22:26+00:00,3,t3_1k4rgmv,t3_1k4rgmv

ADHD meds (not recommended without a prescription or if you're underweight, but I'm not a cop. Just be safe y'all) and coffee I've found can  help. Illicit stims I've never noticed help with that so don't try that just for pooping lol. 

I think fiber pills, increasing fiber in diet, LIGHT exercise (in that I've found just light movement can help so no need to trigger your ed over it yk), not spacing out meals as much if you tend to space them farther than you should, drinking more water, obviously upping intake if possible, and coffee can help.

moea7th,MissCloudy249,"Just wanted to comment my support. I also vaped for 5+ years, started because of ED/restriction reasons. I'm also an adult, mid-20s. I just recently quit and it is so, so worth it and absolutely possible. I've been on idk how many antidepressants for the last 8 years, so I definitely struggle with depression as well. And that's continuious for 8 years, just trying to find the right medication. I only just recently got diagnosed with ADHD and now with Welbutrin and Adderall, I finally feel somewhat average. Definitely still have bad days, but they're less bad than without my current cocktail.

 Anyways, quitting was fucking HARD. I was on the max dose of Lexapro, Wellbutrin and 20mg of Adderall all at the same time. Lexapro fucking obliterated my sex drive (and it used to be all I had that made me happyüò≠), but I also felt the most mentally sound. However, I couldn't take the zero libido any more and started weaning off. I stupidly decided to quit vaping at the same time of stopping Lexapro and my brain and body was fucked for months. I'd get nauseous, brain zaps, brain fog, and I was PISSED at everything. Those were just the top worse symptoms, there were more. It didn't help that I rushed the weaning of Lexapro, but honestly, I'd do it all over again if I had to. Along with the anxiety of wreaking my body, I had terrible guilt about the environmental impact of vaping as well. Also, not wasting money on vapes is reason enough. I spent about the same as you did and I barely make money to pay rent each month lmao.

Not sure what methods you utilized, but thought I'd list mine since my experience was no walk in the park, but it was possible. I'm now 6 months nicotine free and I have close to 0 desire to ever consume again. The only cravings I ever get is for the act of vaping, not so much the nicotine, if that makes sense. The hand to mouth motion was equally addicting for me, just like it is for my ED. Nicotine lozanges were a godsend. I threw away all my vapes and used those and slowly tapered the amount until I could stop completely. This made it to where I could stop the hand to mouth habit, but decrease the amount of somatic effects from the decrease of nicotine. I found keeping my hands busy helped with the psychological urge of hitting my vape. Got a lot done around my apartment and hobbies/projects lol. I also have a list of supplements I take each day with my meds. Won't list them out here, but will give a list if you or anyone wants it. I know you said you're looking into trying the medication route, and Welbutrin is a great med for curbing addictions/additive behaviors. I don't think I would have been able to quit if I wasn't on it, honestly. It took about 3 months until the urge became very quiet and I work around a bunch of guys that vape all day in front of me.

Sorry for the long ass comment, but your comment took me back to exactly how I felt 6 months ago. It does feel hopeless and like life won't be as good without nicotine, but I promise that's just another thing the addiction tells you. You'll only stop when you feel ready, but if you or anyone else even read this, I hope it resonates a little and it'll be one more little push to try again.‚ù§Ô∏è",1745308362.0,2025-04-22T07:52:42+00:00,2,t1_mod6rof,t3_1k4rgmv

mkcyi47,imnobodyscaptive,"EDIT TO EVERYONE BITCHING ABOUT MOM
Everyone jumping on the mom, and maybe it was a little rude, but my god let's have some perspective. In the entirety of your life, have you never took the first portion of food your mother has made? Ever? Not even when you were little and she'd make your plate first to give it time to cool?? Maybe she was working or busy all day and hadn't had an opportunity to eat yet, and maybe you make excellent banana bread and it smelled good and she just wanted a damn piece. She took the end piece, and since most people prefer an inside slice it would seem like she was saving the best for you. 
I forget the age range of most of the posters here. To everyone jumping on the fact that mom ate the first piece as being a warning or a sign of a greater problem, all I can say is you all have a charmed life if *that's* a sign of a bad mother. Good grief yall gotta grow up. Op, it's banana bread. Id bet all the money I have that she's fed you the first portion of food she made more times than you could count. If it bothers you so bad ask her not to cut into what you bake until you do. Or don't. She may or may not be a bad mother, but it damn sure isn't from eating the end piece of banana bread.",1743258344.0,2025-03-29T14:25:44+00:00,2,t3_1jku65v,t3_1jku65v

>2. What's something you like about his physical appearance?

Have you seen the man? Absolutely gorgeous. I think it's the messy hair that caught me, but the glasses? The lab coat? His dark, kind eyes? I'm in love. Bonus: He's actually significantly taller than me.

>3. Do you believe that Maruki is a bit too stubborn about getting the future he believes in? And do you see this as a good thing or a bad thing?

Yes, he was way too stubborn. Like.. you give the protagonist a yes or no to a world so different, nothing is really familiar anymore. I would have liked it if he just >!set up his laboratory in Odaiba and had it open to the public so everyone could go on their own accord,!< but he doesn't like having to wait for so long when he knows he could just do it now.

Not because I hate humans, quite the opposite, actually! There's just no one else as dedicated to a humanitarian issue than he is. I'm majoring in environmental engineering systems to keep people safe, and he has a doctorate in something akin to the cognitive sciences to make sure he gives the best care to people he possibly can. There's only altruism inside of this Gentle Madman, nothing else. *That's* what made me attracted to him. 

>there a reason you don't want to get a 3D lover?

If there is anyone on planet earth that proves to be just as kind, gentle, and patient as he, hmu asap because those people are very rare. Not only is he the best confidant to have, he's the best intellectual partner who will certainly help me move forward with my studies, best support to help deal with my eating disorder, and an absolute Godsend for helping me move past the emotional abuse and trauma from my parents. Anyone who is willing to help me out like that is a person I shall never take for granted.

>Do you talk to him, does he talk back?

Usually using AI dungeon after work/school, but sometimes he appears in my dreams (like when I awakened to Ayame) and sometimes the phisophical questions he poses go straight over my head, but I try my best to be a decent mental backboard.

mm34zwx,aqua4cry,"A lot of hard work. I posted here a few weeks ago that I had maxed out the money counter. Visit every mii, feed them their favorite foods or the most expensive ones if they like it (crab, caviar, truffle, ect) every day. Collect money from the fountain as well. If a mii is over level 20, when they level up, they will give you a coin that is worth either $100 or $200. Most of my miis are over level 20 so I would get over 30 of those coins per day. Also when playing games, I choose the big box because there's a higher chance of getting an expensive item (historical bust, expensive vase, Virtual Boy, ect). It took several months for me to go from $100k - 200k to $999,999.99",1744140487.0,2025-04-08T19:28:07+00:00,5,t1_mm33kre,t3_1ju5wzd

m06liyl,ClinTrial-Throwaway,"Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôd be getting with a telehealth provider instead of whoever you are purchasing from now‚Ä¶

*Mostly copy/pasted from a previous comment:*

My cheap two cents: focus on providers that will ship more than one month of medication at a time and don‚Äôt charge a monthly subscription fee. The last thing you want to do is get caught without a stock of medication when Tirzepatide compounding is forced to end. (And Semaglutide will be forced to end one day soon, too.)

If you are just starting out, I‚Äôd recommend going with Lavender Sky Health ([price list](https://www.lavenderskyhealth.com/medication-pricelist)) and their Tier 1 package from Hallandale Pharmacy, provided they ship to your state ([check here](https://www.lavenderskyhealth.com/pharmacy-state-coverage)).

https://preview.redd.it/67unk62f5m4e1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aff3f07a8a01b56c3c093b0c4eb42ff1099907c1

With this package, you get a total of 40mg of Tirzepatide. Assuming you are trying to stay on low doses, that‚Äôs enough to use a dosing regimen like:

* Four weeks of 3mg (12mg total)
* Six weeks of 4mg (24mg total)

Or you could just bump up to 5mg and have two months of meds.

So for $390, you are getting at least two and possibly as much as 2.5 months of meds. That‚Äôs somewhere between $195 to $156 a month for Tirzepatide.

As soon as you know Tirzepatide is for you, shift to Zappy, SlimDown, Unique Physique, or other providers who are more cost effective at higher doses.",1733223388.0,2024-12-03T10:56:28+00:00,1,t3_1h5fzgj,t3_1h5fzgj

People with BID have the opposite issue, of a specific body part not being registered by their brains as a part that ""shouldn't"" be there. Which means that once amputated, they feel no phantom limb sensations in that area. (In the same way, many trans women who get SRS never get phantom dick.)

The Walking Trees

??: If The Blair Witch Project didn‚Äôt already have me freaked out about the woods, ‚ÄúThe Walking Trees‚Äù did the trick. 

A group of campers are sitting in the woods around a campfire Are You Afraid of the Dark style. One of the campers starts telling the story of ‚Äúthe walking trees‚Äù that supposedly inhabit the very woods they‚Äôre camping in. A modern day witch tale, a witch who inhabits the woods was getting more and more fed up with the carelessness of the campers who would litter her woods with garbage. One day when she sees several campers leave behind trash, she decides enough is enough. The campers stop in their tracks, unable to move as their feet take root in the ground, and they turn into trees. The witch curses them, saying that for one night every year, they will be able to walk, and they have to find new campers in the woods to take their place as walking trees in order to break the spell.

Not believing the story, our campers go to sleep. One of the campers, Michael, tells his tent-mate Tim that he‚Äôs going to go freak out everyone else by scratching on the tents. He runs out of the tent‚Ä¶and Tim hears a muffled shriek. He shrugs it off, assuming it to be part of the practical joke.

The next morning, Tim wakes up to an empty tent. Michael still hasn‚Äôt returned. As he steps out of the tent, in front of it there stands a massive tree that wasn‚Äôt there before. In fact, all around the campsite are newly standing trees‚Ä¶made of the other campers. Tim tries to get away, but his feet start to take root, and he becomes a tree himself, waiting for the next year when he can walk.",1656042783.0,2022-06-24T03:53:03+00:00,1,t1_id2o3tj,t3_vg3pd6

Your cold may be exacerbating an existing muscular weakness. As far as I understand the only permanent solution is surgery. Luckily for me it hasn't ever gotten so bad for that to be necessary, it happens when I'm VERY stressed/worried about a performance, or sometimes playing outside. I have found that stopping and taking a drink of water helps. You might also think about adjusting your reeds so that less pressure is needed - for me, since I switched from modern to baroque oboe (whose reeds take much MUCH less air pressure), this has only happened to me once.

A colleague of mine had corrective surgery for it - no complications and now she's able to play without problems. I would freak tf out if I had to have surgery on my throat, but would do it if the alternative were giving up my oboe career (such as it is, nowadays...)

this is why im not really fond of the ""boop the snoot"" culture as 90% of snakes dont like it at all.

The rodents will never outgrow your snake.

Bps are notoriously picky, though, and tend to be difficult to switch.  Generally, you just need perseverance and a little creativity.  People tend to give up after 2-4 months of failing to switch, with relatively few options tested.  Took me 1.5 years to switch my bp after eating live 5-6 years.

Dude, that‚Äôs either an excuse to not quit, or you‚Äôre in a really toxic place.

Two possibilities are at play here as to why I suspect it‚Äôs a problem for the folks that you care about (and care about you) quitting smoking:
1. They don‚Äôt want you to quit, because that will make them feel bad for continuing.
2. They don‚Äôt want to deal with your mood shifts while going through the nicotine withdrawals, which will happen.

n3w80w9,Jmckeown2,"Yea, you‚Äôre in the rollercoaster stage of the meds. The side effects can get wacky as the drug levels in your body rise and fall. You‚Äôll definitely feel better in a day or two, but it may be even a little worse the 24-40 hours after your next shot. Weeks 3 & 4 you start to adapt. Then you start all over again on the next dose.

Once you make it to your ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù dose though you should stop experiencing most unpleasantness. (Except constipation) I mean, there will be ‚Äútrigger foods‚Äù that make you feel gross, but you‚Äôll be able to avoid them pretty easily. This week, my kids wanted a birthday dinner that I expected to seriously trigger me, but I ate anyway because ‚Äúmy kids‚Äù but I was fine.

Now, for me, ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù is definitely 2.4. Novo also says 1.7 is acceptable. But many find side effects get better at 1.0, and others have no complaints whatsoever. If your insurance is fine with wherever you feel fine, then great. But if insurance makes you move to an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù maintenance dose, don‚Äôt fear it.

The side effects get bad because you‚Äôre getting more drug than you can handle, but also because you‚Äôre getting not enough to fully acclimate to it. This is counter intuitive, but moving up ultimately makes side effects better, even though they may be worse initially. So really, if you‚Äôre on week 4, and still feeling like crap, it may be better to hold for another 4 weeks. Whereas if you‚Äôre feeling fine on week 4, but food noise is sneaking back in, move up, even knowing the side effects may come back for a bit.",1752876099.0,2025-07-18T22:01:39+00:00,1,t3_1m36t1m,t3_1m36t1m

I‚Äôm very lucky that I grew up where both sides of my family had happy independent childfree people for generations before me. What I can say, is that you need to make your own life goals.

For example, visiting every continent/country? Hiking the tallest peaks in the world? Work in community to build something tangible like a community garden? Fundraise for a charity that means a lot to you? Strive to buy big things like a house? Get a pet? Get really good at a hobby? 

It‚Äôs also really important to find other childfree people to be around. I know other couples who are also CF and it makes life so much better and less lonely.

Additionally, not sure what binder you have, but mine was kinda just a stretchy band, and the nurse at my post op appointment cut little half circles where my armpits went.

There's nothing sacred about the binder that your surgeon gave you‚Äîthe part that matters if that your chest is being compressed.

It's really important to wear the binder for a while post op so that your chest skin reattaches to your muscles. Right now your skin is just free floating over your pec muscles, and the binder compressing it makes it much easier to reattach while healing. If you don't, fluid and blood could build up in the pockets and block that from happening.

mwuxssg,horny_shit_face_lift,"my autistic partner didn't wear theirs long enough (and was bad with aftercare) and did to many movements too fast again. one of their scars is very stretched, the other completely keloid. they have a flat* chest now that's all that counts for them and they said their body looks just like they use it. in an autistic way. 

*add: their chest is not completely flat, others are right about the fluid building up and that it's harder for tissue to reattach to the muscles etc. but they don't mind since they are chubby and it fit's their body type.

no shame on people who can't deal with the aftercare. it will not look cis passing but you are allowed to prioritise your mental health. also acupuncture and physiotherapy from practitioners that know about scarcare (and optimally also about mastectomies) can help a lot to soften scars afterwards. 

my physiotherapist explained me what happens when you put too much pressure on the scar too early (like you have to be careful until month 6).
the incision is a cut made horizontally through several layers of skin/fat/tissue. these layers are put together so the scar is not only what you see outside, but also goes horizontally inwards. if the scar is on too much stress from lifting something for example, the body sends the tissue signals to get hard and ""attatch"" itself more to the tissue underneath. so it can get stuck on your rib area for example and lessen your movement ability long term. for this you can do certain (daily) massages also, that loosen the tissue.

keloids are basically when the scar tissue outside is trying to ""hold"" the scar and is healing faster than inside tissue. the scar gets harder and ""grows"" outwards. 

stretched scars happen more when the inside tissue is healing faster than the outside, so it tries to hold everything together while the outside is softer and stretches out.

the west is supporting the insisions/scars in the scarring process so the scars are not under too much pressure. additionaly you can use scartape and take care of your movements, how much weight you lift, etc.

there is an explanation what happens, so hopefully you can decide what you want to do or what you are able to do, what not.

either way congratulations on your top surgery and i hope you are happy with your results whatever the process will be :))",1749487716.0,2025-06-09T16:48:36+00:00,5,t3_1l77hrt,t3_1l77hrt

mwvhbgt,[deleted],"I'm autistic too and dreading this exact scenario.

What I'm thinking of doing is taking a pair of tights and cutting the legs off, and scooting that up over my chest. The tights I wear compress my tummy a lot but are way more breathable of a fabric than a binder is. I'm still pre-op though so this is just a theory. Tights are a couple bucks a pop at Walmart if you want to try it though! 

Some surgeons don't use drains or binders, but that does increase chances of complications. It's been done, but it's not without it's issues. As everyone here has said, there's really good reasons to use it.

I had a different major surgery which required me to sometimes wear a compression garment around my abdomen and one time because I neglected to wear it I ended up writhing on the floor screaming in pain for like 20 minutes because nobody could hear me and come help me. That nightmare alone I think will help me keep my binder on lmao.

I even had a small infection (not from my binder or anything) and it was very uncomfortable as it was swollen too.. though I like to think that the deep pressure from the binder helped a little. I worry that my initial reply was too dismissive or strict, so I came back!

What I found worked well were socks! If you have any thick or fluffy socks use them as a barrier between your skin and the compression binder. I also wore a clean shirt underneath my binder towards the end of my sentence on it (because it does feel like a prison sentence at times lol) and that helped a lot with pinching and digging in.

Ultimately the most important thing is to wear it, even if it sucks. 

I know how impossible that can feel as autistic meltdowns and overstimulation can feel like literal torture. It really does suck, but remember that this will be the last binder you'll ever have to wear. 

All of those years you've been strong and managed to put up with binding in some way I'd imagine. This is literally the finish line my friend, you just need to hang on for the last couple hurdles. You're allowed to feel upset, uncomfortable. Heck, so many trans guys have a big whinge about it and not all are autistic. It's a known thing to hate this part, but honestly it's so, so worth it.

Absolutely talk to your surgeon about this when you can though. Explain your situation and hopefully they understand autism enough to be empathetic. You'll most likely just be told to try your best to just deal with it, but you can absolutely request them for help with this process.

 The healing process is the scariest part for the surgeon funnily enough as they all REALLY want their procedure to go well for you. Once you leave the operating room they tend to feel very powerless and anxious about their patients healing as all they can do now is hope your body heals and that you give your body the best possible chance to heal in the best possible way.

For now, do you have any healthy self soothing techniques you can deploy? Do you have a comfort movie or show that you haven't watched in a while? Maybe a game you played a couple years ago that you really enjoyed is due a replay? Are there any specific special safe foods you only eat when you're feeling rotten?

Well I‚Äôm 3Xchonky before surgery and the limited options in that size are two I got at $80 each and one I got at $123 on sale ($154 regular). The sizing charts were wrong and the more expensive one was low res and blurry hence why I had to order three to get the size correct. The 3Xchonky one I got still fit weirdly.

mwcix5t,atratus3968,"Sorry to come back to this, but it really is not just a matter of believing each other individually or not. It's a matter of structural denial of appropriate medical care because of a widespread and false belief that it is intrinsically not painful to experience.

I was talked down to and met with derision by medical professionals, had my pain dismissed and ignored repeatedly during the removal itself, was treated like I was overreacting and drug seeking before my appointment for being concerned about pain, and have had multiple people respond to my experiences with it being painful with ""okay well *mine* didn't hurt"".

The overwhelming majority of people believe you when you say it didn't hurt. Medical professionals believe you. Other people who have had drains removed believe you. The only people who may question whether it hurt you or not are the people who have no experience with the procedure and generally quickly accept it when you say it didn't hurt. You aren't being forced to take medication beforehand to prevent the pain. You aren't having doctors and nurses roll their eyes and laugh at you for *not* feeling pain during the procedure. You aren't having medical professionals insist to you that you undeniably did experience pain and that there's no possible way that you *didn't*. It is just not the same level of belief vs denial in regards to structural denial of appropriate medical care and properly informing and listening to patients.

I know I'm being kinda touchy about this but I'm chronically ill and have severe chronic pain. I have faced a frankly unbelievable amount of people, including and especially medical professionals, who have insisted to me that something couldn't possibly be causing me pain and denying me adequate treatment for it.

This isn't about people not believing the ones who say it didn't hurt at all, considering it not hurting is already the accepted and insisted upon condition.

I was told I could take pain meds afterwards if it really was that bad, but that wouldn't have helped with the removal itself :[ Pain mitigation beforehand is what is most relevant/important for drain removal procedures.

I had pretty much the same issue when I had a uretral stent removed after kidney stone surgery a few years ago, where I was denied pain prevention because the doctors didn't believe it could hurt. It's a horribly widespread issue across the entirety of medicine that inserting/removing certain things like drains, stents, IUDs, etc isn't painful, and the people who find it painful are just drug seeking or weak.

mwfyyb9,atratus3968,"I mean, I had been reporting to that office that I was having extreme sensitivity in my chest afterwards and that I could feel the drains inside me, and that I had nearly passed out from pain multiple times when they had been even lightly touched. I had to take the provided opiate meds before even stripping the tubes and emptying the bottles(?) every 8 hours because of how much it hurt, and I had to get a prescription for a much stronger opiate because the hydrocodone I was initially given did nothing for me. I wasn't even asking for more pain meds, just whether I should save one of the ones from my post-surgery prescription for the drain removal. I've had multiple surgeries before, I know what hurts me, I know how my body reacts to certain things, and I knew enough to know that this would hurt me.

And I *still* was told that it couldn't possibly hurt to have them yanked out despite all that, and was actively ignored during my appointment when I expressed pain and asked them to be more careful, because they just did not believe me. 

I love my surgeon on his own, but the nurses at his office were extremely dismissive of my pain throughout recovery, and that is not even close to the only time I've had medical professionals deny that I could possibly experience pain because most *normal* people don't. I have spent a long, *long* time dealing with medical professionals with strong biases to not believe patients about their pain, as I have hypermobile Ehlers Danlos and a variety of other chronic conditions. It's a widespread and ongoing issue across all of medicine. 

It doesn't matter if it's an uncommon experience. It's still something that is possible to experience, and I would argue that it is far more harmful to undergo such a painful experience without care or precaution or warning than it is to take a single dose of preventative pain relief. I'd rather be given the option to avoid pain and have it be an unnecessary precaution than to be denied that relief and just be treated as an unusual exception to a hard rule in the aftermath.

mwdu8gx,hamletandskull,"Well, anecdotes are anecdotes, but I've never known anyone in person for whom drain removal hurt any more than ripping off a bandage, and I don't see why any nurse would have an incentive to lie about how many patients they see report pain from drain removal. It's not like this is a thing people generally experience than once in their lives, so they have no worries of people exaggerating to get drugs. And they're quite up front about it being uncomfortable if not generally painful. 

Clearly it does hurt for some people, but part of the reason why ""everyone says"" it doesn't hurt is because we've been having this surgery for decades and overall people don't report drain removal hurting. It's only recently that the trans community has even been able to rely on doctors for information, almost all of the info about surgery and recovery comes from other trans people, none of whom have an incentive to lie or underexaggerate their experiences. 

Like, either every nurse who says it usually doesn't hurt, and most trans people who say it didn't hurt are lying for no purpose other than your suffering (since even if they said yeah it's gonna hurt, you wouldn't necessarily get pain meds about it), or it really does not seem to hurt most people and it's relatively rare when it does. It sucks for the people who it does hurt, and people should phrase it as more of a ""it *might* hurt"" situation, but I don't think people are deliberately ignoring pain, I think they genuinely haven't run across someone for whom drain removal hurt before.",1749243723.0,2025-06-06T21:02:03+00:00,0,t1_mwdiojl,t3_1l4una3
mwegfzo,SeaAmbassadorBow,"There are systemic and unconscious biases that can lead medical professionals to discount or disbelieve patient reports of pain.  Some of the reasons can include unconscious or conscious biases connected to the population, and a preconception that the procedure is supposed to be painless.  For a horrific example of the latter (and a bit of the former) you could listen to this podcast series.

[The Retrievals](https://open.spotify.com/show/6EvG4iL7sOi8L4UrzLopmE?si=Cjm_PkSqQhOfa3Z2RHyWmA)

On a hunch, I took a look at a breast cancer mastectomy discussion about whether drain removal hurts, and in that particular sample group, it was about 2:1 no pain vs some pain.  And when I looked online for patient info in the cancer context, the patient info I found first said it usually doesn't hurt, but can ache afterward, and then it discusses pain management in terms of taking an OTC med in advance and/or taking OTC meds after.  So it's not depicted as incredibly rare for it to hurt.

I had drainless surgery, so I have no stake one way or the other, really.  I just don't like seeing assumptions and anecdotes instead of data, and particularly assumptions like ""all these medical professionals would have no reason to lie"" when it's not necessarily that simple. 

There's nothing about top surgery that would keep the patient from being seen as drug-seeking.  And that's probably even more likely to be the view if the practitioner thinks of the procedure as very unlikely to be painful.",1749251203.0,2025-06-06T23:06:43+00:00,2,t1_mwdu8gx,t3_1l4una3

mvatmvz,Quagga_Resurrection,"The post-op bloating is real.

u/funkydyke, it's absolutely a combination of water retention, inflammation/tissue swelling, and the anticholinergic effects of anesthesia and painkillers (anticholinergic = dampens nervous system and slows body down) which slows your digestion a fair bit and leads to the usual constipation and bloating.

In my experience, it takes about a week post-op for your body to get back to normal plus a few days after stopping prescription painkillers (opiates and muscle relaxers, not NSAIDs).

Be nice to your body. Give it Gatorade and lots of rest. The better you take care of yourself, the faster you'll heal and get back to normal.",1748722234.0,2025-05-31T20:10:34+00:00,48,t1_mva63aa,t3_1l034df

mmywdki,Neenknits,"If you slip the first or last stitch whichever method, it will have half as much yarn in the edge as the rest of the fabric.  This makes any seam
Less stretchy and More gappy.  

There is a much easier way to *completely fix* the issue.  

For the first 3 and last 3 stitches of every row, from now until forever, simply work the stitches gently.  Slide the needle in and out, keeping the needles touching.  When pulling the new loop through the old stitch, don‚Äôt let the needles separates, just slide it out a bit and keep them touching as you pull the stitch through and off the needle.  

This is because when a loop mid row gets stretched borrows yarn from adjacent stitches, and it springs back after.  When an end stitch gets stretched, it borrows from the row below, but the twists and turns of the end of one row and start of the next means the yarn snugs up to almost a knot, trapping all that borrowed yarn unhinge elongated stitch.   Working gently and sliding the needles simply prevents this.

I mean, kinda? It‚Äôs very possible to get neat edges without slipping stitches. I would not teach someone to always slip edge stitches by default (instead of teaching them how to assess and choose to intentionally slip on a per-project basis), just because there are going to be cases where this may be to your disadvantage: if a piece is going to be seamed, for example, as slipped stitches may alter the number and construction of the edge stitches available to seam with. If a new knitter doesn‚Äôt know better, following overgeneralized advice could lead to some real headaches down the line.

OP, your twisted stitches on every purl row are the culprit here, along with very uneven tension. This commenter‚Äôs advice about slipping edge stitches is helpful once you have correct technique, but you need to fix the twisted stitches and improve your tension first.",1744559786.0,2025-04-13T15:56:26+00:00,14,t1_mmwoq3p,t3_1jy9lpe

mdqwgr7,[deleted],"There are many reasons. Some go without saying, while others are entirely spiritual and cannot be put into words. Most are health related, mentally and physically. Then, there is a handful, that are ‚Äúseemingly insignificant‚Äù.

My abusive ex is the worst alcoholic I have ever met in my entire life. I am a pretty bad alcoholic myself, but nothing compares to him. I guess that‚Äôs how I justified my addiction for a while. He hurt me in ways that nobody ever has, and I‚Äôll never be the same person as I was before I met this disgraceful man.

One of the first times I tried to escape from this relationship, he reeled me back in. He told me that he went to the hospital and was told he had six months to live. When I tell you I sobbed for hours on end, I mean it. I could barely breathe. I was literally choking on my own tears. ‚ÄúNot Vinnie!‚Äù, I said over and over and over. I was basically screaming his name, and saying ‚ÄúNO‚Äù, over and over and over. I thought the man I loved, the man that I thought was my soulmate, the man I thought was my best friend only had six months left with me. I JUST HAD TO go back to him, and spend the rest of his days together.

Well, turns out, he lied. He never went to the hospital. His kidneys were not failing (I‚Äôm sure they are, he has all the symptoms, but no, he did not go to the hospital). Apparently he also had kidneys stones but he ‚Äúpeed them out‚Äù. I begged for him to go to the hospital! He lied to me! I was so angry! But, yet, I stayed with him, again and again. I finally, once and for all, escaped his wrath in November. I had a restraining order against him for 3 months from May-August, and went back to him AGAIN. I lifted the restraining order. I want to get it back because he has been virtually stalking me. Hundreds of missed calls from numbers created with apps, and recently a voicemail from him, with no CALLER ID. Hearing his voice again made me want to throw up. I am keeping it, though. Because I need this restraining order back. I hope I can find the courage to do it. I‚Äôm scared of being looked down upon in court for getting the order lifted. I thought this man loved me. I thought he was my soulmate. Turns out, he didn‚Äôt stop emotionally abusing me. He OWNS a part of me that I will NEVER get back. I should have left for good when I found out that he lied about having six months to live.

This happened about a year ago (maybe a little over a year ago), when he lied about this. And now, as I‚Äôm typing this out, I am completely triggered and NOW FINALLY REALIZE that I NEVER WANT TO BE THAT PERSON THAT LIES! I never want to be that person that begs for someone‚Äôs attention under the influence of alcohol, and under the death sentence that alcohol truly is. I quit 4 days ago. My doctor even gave me medication that is forcing me to quit.

My ex was not, and WILL NEVER BE, insignificant. He was my world, and he destroyed my life. I‚Äôm still dealing with the emotional pain he caused, which almost lead me to being homeless (and I‚Äôm still at risk for). Some may say that‚Äôs insignificant, and has nothing to do with him.

I would not wish this pain on anyone. Nobody. Yet, I still love him. This is the first time I‚Äôve ‚Äúsaid‚Äù his name in months (in this comment). His name alone gives me PTSD. He scares me. He is a monster.

mdr4wqm,Libra-Wolf,"At one point when my alcoholism was really out of control, I would start with a shot of tequila or two, then drink an entire bottle of wine and then some. Often, wine and tequila simultaneously. Alternating shots and chugging wine to get as blasted as possible as quickly as possible.
‚Ä¶.One night when I was already over a bottle of wine deep, I invited one of my friends who also drinks a lot over. He brought a big bottle of rum. We started making mixed drinks and blasting music til 6am, going on a bender. I had to work later that night(day). At work, as the most awful headache was beginning to set in, I couldn‚Äôt ignore my nausea any longer and beelined for the bathroom. I was so dehydrated it felt like my throat was coated in chalk. I threw up so violently that tiny red petechiae appeared all over my face, mainly around my eyes. A bunch of tiny blood vessels in my eyes popped as well, so they were red rimmed, and my entire face swelled up, especially around the eyes. I looked at myself in the mirror as drool trickled down my chin and a little voice said, ‚Äúif you keep this up, you‚Äôre gonna die.‚Äù It sounds crazy, but it looked like an alien version of myself looking back at me. I sure felt like death. It was terrifying. 

Also, I was spending all my fucking money on booze. As a normally frugal person, sober me finally had had enough. I also wasn‚Äôt above flirting with people just to get them to buy me a drink‚Äîanything to get my fix. Then sober me would feel so slimy afterwards. 

Furthermore, I read an awful story on this sub about someone who was only 30 or so drinking themselves to death and bleeding out from ruptured varices/total organ failure. That has honestly stuck with me hardcore.

Also, my hang-xiety was getting so bad. I knew when I needed a hair of the dog in the morning to stave off the anxiety that it was getting worse. My heart would race in that state, and there were several times where it felt like there was a cloud of impending doom hanging over me all day.

I drank Smirnoff.   Like a parasite that takes over the host, routine daily transmorphism became autonomic reality.
Until they ran out of Smirnoff.  

I drank it straight, and chugged.  But any off brand would trigger nausea (ketoacedosis), and i would puke it up.   I sometimes would anticipate this, and do a quick shot off the top, to get the puking out of the way.   Or later,  puke in a seperate cup, so i could re-drink it.  Didn't wanna waste it,.and it was somewhat clean anyways cause I didn't eat!  That stuff was pricey too, and I rationed.  My budget allowed for so many ounces daily, which broke into ounces per hour.  Eventually tailspinning to what budget and how many ounces will it take to blackout?
The last couple of years were a living hangover.  Reliving a perpetually drunk Grounhog day, my mental health declined rapidly.  Calling in at work, delivery Vodka and food, rapidly becoming the poster child for bad hygiene and who gives a fucks.

If it's not your time to go, your HP won't  let you. I WAS sick and tired of being sick in the head and tired in the body and spirit.  So i was done with the struggle.  Alcohol won.   Always did.  I didn't know how to give up fighting, move over and ask for help.  Impending doom is scary, so I drank like it was my last see ya later, and got behind the wheel of my Dodge Journey.  I turned the utility pole into matchsticks, no seat belt on, so I went through the windshield.   Totalled the car, but i didn't even get a scratch.  

My life is sober.  I share my life, mostly with people connected to addiction recovery.  But also with family and friends. Alcoholics have a commonality, that's unique to them, and that's what makes us such a powerful community.   We pick each other up when we fall, because we fall, a lot.  We also make sure we prevent falls, best we can, with the tools AA provides us with.  We just have to 'Work' with all of the tools, to stay vigilant of our sobriety. Every step, tradition, fellowship, prayer, meditation, the whole tool kit.",1740028840.0,2025-02-20T05:20:40+00:00,9,t3_1itni7k,t3_1itni7k

The Shining is a movie (and novel) I've loved from a long long time. I shared it with my older kid, and now we're both fans. The thing is, one reason I love it is that the three main characters each embody one aspect of who I am.

Cue several years later when I finally got my hands on the movie adaptation of Doctor Sleep. A lot of passages echoed how I felt, and things I knew applied to me (but didn't dare face head on) were said out loud in that movie.

Then I stumbled upon that story from Mike Flanagan:

2 non health reasons. 
- I actually drank so much for so long that I didn't enjoy the flavor of anything anymore. So many different profiles of wine but at the end of the day it still tastes like wine. So many different seltzers and coolers but they're either just watered down alcohol or super sweet alcohol. I realized going to the liquor store and looking for my poison of the day. There wasn't anything that truly appealed to me. I drank up until midnight on New year's Eve and I haven't had a drop since. I feel like I've had enough alcohol for one lifetime. I take Wellbutrin as antidepressant and I think that it's helping me maintain this mentality. 

- I've saved $450 in 49 days. It's $10 a day. At my age I look at my bank account and my lack of wealth and I realize I don't have $10 a day of disposable income.

The second fall, hit my head, bleeding head and second concussion.  Was lying in a back alley, in the winter. Nearly decided to just sleep there. Would have froze to death. 
I decided to do controlled drinking after both times. We all know how well that works, LOL. Perhaps the biggest lie we tell ourselves is that we can stick to just a one drink. 
FYI, I drink less than anyone I know. But my body can‚Äôt seem to metabolise alcohol. My Dad was the same, he would sip on a quart of beer at home watching TV all night. Be completely plastered drunk off 32 oz of beer. I am the same, 12 oz of beer and I am officially acting drunk.

So only a bit over a month. I hope I keep with this. I do have hope as so far it feels easy. I will say, no withdraws for me because I can go a month easy never thinking about drinking. So I always thought I‚Äôm not an alcoholic. But finally in writing I will say it, I‚Äôm an alcoholic because 1 beer can‚Äôt just be 1 beer.

My brother & Dad both died and were alcoholics, they died fairly young 48 & 62. 

I know for a fact I could have died in these 2 falls. Or be crippled. I had a friend drink & hit his head falling in a shower & died. I see my future if I have just one. 

I will also say for clarity I‚Äôve had multiple brain injuries from my friend as teens driving drunk & she totalled a car & that‚Äôs head injury number 1. Then I was in a car and a drunk & high driver hit our car. Head injury number two. Then I had a 55 pound speaker randomly fall on my head in a poker tournament (our seats were assigned by number).

I spent NY day and the day after that feeling horrible enough to swear off alcohol for good. I don't regret it, almost 2 months in. I'm so happy I made the choice actually.

Ultimately I got tired of feeling like shit and adjusting my life to fit alcohol into it.

Normally I'd just slam a couple beers in the garage to start the day and head to the store to get more. But I decided I would wait until I got shakey and drink just one. And repeat that until the 4 beers were gone. It took 2 days and I just stopped. Got through the withdrawals and that was the end. Struggled a bit for the first year, every experience was ""new"" because I had to learn how to navigate life in sobriety. 

I no longer feel like hot garbage every day and I no longer need to adjust my life to fit alcohol. I took the position at work that I knew would be a great fit but required 24/7 on-call periods. Not an issue now.",1740094762.0,2025-02-20T23:39:22+00:00,1,t3_1itni7k,t3_1itni7k

I'm working nights now which means I actually feel like eating at breakfast time, and the other day I actually made myself some hashbrowns after seeing how low calorie they are without being drenched in oil. Hashbrowns are one of the two breakfast foods I actually really like (the other being biscuits and gravy, definitely not low calorie!) and I was so pleased to realize they aren't as bad as I thought, and also a little mad that I went so long without realizing.

Of course as I say this, the truth is that I've made myself hash browns exactly once and am constructing a whole new breakfast identity based on one morning, lol.

Normally though when I'm waking up in the morning instead of coming home from work I'm closest to a hyperracist neo-reactionary (really not caring for these categories I'm meeting!). I'll take my meds but nothing else. *Maybe* I'll force a couple bites of a protein bar or peanut butter to get some protein/energy in, but I just never feel like eating for a while after I wake up.",1696200891.0,2023-10-01T22:54:51+00:00,1,t3_16x0qex,t3_16x0qex

jxpduoi,pinkiepieie,"I‚Äôm bored so here‚Äôs a little guide:

1. You‚Äôll need something to remove ur spf (and makeup if you wear any). Most ppl use either a micellar water or a cleansing oil, a micellar water is less messy in my opinion bc you use it with a cotton pad but the oil might be a better option if you struggle with blackheads or sebaceous filaments (looks like blackheads but are lighter in color). My fav micellar water is the bioderma sensibio one and I also like the nuxe cleansing oil but ngl I think you could just use about any cheap cleansing oil as long as it doesn‚Äôt irritate ur skin bc you‚Äôll cleanse ur skin after this either way.

2. Water based cleanser: You can‚Äôt rly go wrong with French skincare brands, but I suggest to not get a cleanser with actives since this could unnecessarily irritate ur skin and leave on treatments usually work better if ur struggling with acne or anything similar. I really like the bioderma sensibio cleansing gel but depending on ur skin type you might prefer a cleansing lotion or foam.

3. Toner (optional according to some ppl but i can‚Äôt live without them): sometimes also called essence but nowadays they‚Äôre basically the same thing. These can have actives like bha but I usually like to use hydrating ones bc my skin is basically always dehydrated. If you have something like blackheads or acne I‚Äôd suggest using a toner with 2% bha starting 2-3 times a week and increasing the frequency if you‚Äôre skin can handle it. If ur extra or don‚Äôt feel like you need a bha toner then get urself a hydrating one. I love korean and Japanese toners and they‚Äôre also pretty cheap, I buy them from yesstyle. Also if ur ordering something from yesstyle search for coupon codes online, you‚Äôll usually be able to find a 10-15% coupon. Never buy full price.

4. Serum (again you don‚Äôt need it and I don‚Äôt always use one but they‚Äôre nice to have depending on ur skin concerns): Just like with toners there‚Äôs a huge variety of serums that do different things but serums usually have higher percentage of actives than toners and are therefore more potent but can also be more irritating. If you just want something basic I‚Äôd suggest a barrier repairing serum bc a healthy skin barrier should always be the top priority in skincare, something with ceramides would be nice. There are a lot of skincare ingredients and actives that do a wide variety of things. I‚Äôm currently using the the ordinary alpha arbutin serum and have been using it for over a year, it‚Äôs hydrating and the alpha arbutin helps with hyperpigmentation.

5. Additional treatments: a lot of ppl use a serum or toner with actives to treat skincare concerns like hyperpigmentation, rosacea, acne, eczema and so on but this step is usually for treatments that are prescribed by a doctor. For example I‚Äôm using a tretinoin gel for my acne, but I guess you won‚Äôt be needing anything here.

6. Moisturizer: Choose a moisturizer depending on ur skin type and make sure that you find one that makes ur skin feel hydrated and nice throughout the day. I‚Äôm gonna suggest to go with a French skincare brand again, they usually have a lot of different ranges for different skin types and concerns. Just experiment, maybe ask the next time you go to a pharmacy for free sample bc at least here in Germany they give a bunch of free samples from multiple brands. I have oily skin that‚Äôs very dehydrated from the tretinoin that I‚Äôm using so I layer the bioderma atoderm gel with the la roche Posay cicaplast at night and use the bioderma sebium hydra moisturizer in the morning bc I need something more moisturizing at night. You might find that using a different moisturizer at night and in the morning under ur spf also works better for you. 

7. Spf (only in the morning obviously): you seem to already have one but if you feel like you want to change it up I‚Äôd suggest you to look into Korean, Japanese, Australian and French sunscreens, they do it the best imo. 

The order is in the morning and at night pretty much the same but obviously no spf at night and no first cleanse in the morning. Some ppl prefer to not cleansed their skin in the morning at all and just wash their face with water, this is again just what works for you. Your routine should fit you, not just ur skin type but also ur lifestyle. If ur not someone who doesn‚Äôt have a lot of time or you just don‚Äôt enjoy doing ur skincare than keep it simple and just cleanse and moisturize (and spf in the morning). You don‚Äôt have to use a toner and a serum and this and that bc everyone else seems to use them, there‚Äôs no right or wrong way to do this. Also don‚Äôt get anything that‚Äôs expensive, most of the time you‚Äôll be able to find something similar that‚Äôs way cheaper. Another thing is that if you decide to use actives you should always look for signs of irritation. Good luck on ur skincare journey and don‚Äôt get too addicted so you don‚Äôt end up broke like me.",1692977082.0,2023-08-25T15:24:42+00:00,3,t1_jxo36ob,t3_160clw9

Those things are better than going to dinner for a date anyway, you get to experience how a person is intellectually, what they‚Äôre like when they‚Äôre winning or losing, how they deal with frustrations etc. I always go with activities for dates early in a relationship over an awkward meal that can feel like an interview.",1668032566.0,2022-11-09T22:22:46+00:00,8,t1_ivq4qao,t3_yqkze5

iook5l7,Ghostiet,"the storyline was put on pause when HOOK accepted the challenge from the LA Dojo. Danhausen came out ot hype him up, HOOK gently told him that he's got this and since then they've been working separately. they've done some references to their team up over time - HOOK pointedly came out to challenge Ricky Starks after he beat Danhausen, Danhausen has also been employing some surprising (for the character) technical moves in his matches and it's all but implied that HOOK taught him that.

I think they ran into a simple booking issue with the team, especially when it was put together only because OC got injured and it left Danhausen without a partner. HOOK is over as hell and his first loss has to be a big deal that starts a feud that gets him to the next level; he can't peak too early either because he's still green and barely 23, and the last thing they want with him is to run into the Jade problem; Danhausen was out with injury for some time and he's the sort of character that works in layers - it's better to tell a story of him becoming more and more competent in the ring; and the tag division is stacked and there's a lot of people in line. Danhausen would be there to eat pins but it would still diminish the impact of HOOK's first loss, losing constantly would make the pairing lose a lot of steam and there would be also the question of why are they even teaming up if they ain't winning.

I'm pretty sure they'll be back once the story makes sense for both of them to get a bit of gold or shine on them. I think Danhausen would be the one running in at Zero Hour if Action Bronson had schedule issues they couldn't resolve.",1663344711.0,2022-09-16T16:11:51+00:00,18,t1_ioo305h,t3_xfqdkg

mwvpoig,weirdoismywaifu,"I was in a similar situation in freshman year of college. Due to some mix-up, I got placed in housing with all (presumably) cis men, rather than the gender-inclusive housing I requested. When I entered college I had just started to pass 100% of the time, so I was worried I wouldn't pass to people. Time passed and nobody seemed to know (including my roommate somehow), but it was eating me up inside having to hide this part of myself from others. I was being super careful in the showers, always slouching when I couldn't bind my chest (like when I was getting ready to sleep), and always worried the littlest things like cadence of my voice, posture, or stance, would out me to others. Eventually I came out to a few of my friends who lived on the floor with me, and they continued to treat me the same after. I saw myself in them more and more, in the ways they would sometimes be a little awkward, or do something a little feminine like paint their nails purple despite being straight, sing along to girly kpop songs in the shower, etc. Sometimes, they seemed a little unsure of themselves. I realized *they were just like me in the ways that matter*. People are just people. You are not an alien from another planet, you are not some creature, you are just like everyone else and just like the cis men you hang out with. Being stealth can come with a lot of insecurity, but remember that everyone deals with that, and every man deals with feeling ""not man enough"", feeling a little lonely, feeling a little like an outsider. You are not alone. Some trials are just a part of being human.",1749495403.0,2025-06-09T18:56:43+00:00,28,t3_1l7bdu1,t3_1l7bdu1

I was recovered for several years and at a healthy weight as well when I got very unwell with Crohns and was finally diagnosed. Not sure if having an ED earlier contributed to this as Crohn‚Äôs disease is usually a genetic thing.
But the thing is: yes I do have massive stomach and digestive problems because of it and I can‚Äôt eat everything sadly‚Ä¶ but I am also disabled so I can‚Äôt move that much. Don‚Äôt even have the energy to do yoga or something. 
Some individuals may seriously develop gastroparesis after their ed and I don‚Äôt want to invalidate them but I feel like a lot just pick up on it and use the most useful symptoms like not being able to tolerate food to use them as an excuse. Chronic illness does not work like that and it literally changes your life so you will often be forced to give up your job, studies and all your hobbies as well because you are just not able to do them anymore. 
Also a bit funny to me like everybody suddenly claims to have gastroparesis but nobody even chooses the illness I have (crohn‚Äôs disease) üòÇ I guess if you can choose your lie ‚Äûparalyzed stomach‚Äú still sounds better than a bowel disease üòÇ",1752910805.0,2025-07-19T07:40:05+00:00,21,t3_1m32wjw,t3_1m32wjw

Exit aisle seats are great. Many airlines are now charging extra for them, whereas they used to just give them to the tall people who needed the room the most.

Another option is using credit card points to book business class, particularly if you‚Äôre traveling alone as it is generally pretty easy to find single seats on or around the days you want to travel. I always look for them for our Europe trips and sometimes get one or even 2 (if I‚Äôm lucky) out of the 3 booked on points.

Companies like Black Rock and State Street. The notoriously predatory ones.

When you have that level of ownership by a small number of companies, whose (foreign) board members know each other personally, and the rest of the corporate ownership is splintered amongst many small (Australian) owners, the big foreign guys get a disproportionate say on who sits on the boards here, and what decisions they make.

In short, you have predatory absentee landlords, with agents at the big tables, who really don't give a fuck about local wages, conditions, or even local customer starvation.

It's a major factor in inflation of Australian consumer items.

Another major factor is that those items are increasingly owned and produced overseas by the same fucken companies. Or their mates.

Does it cost you more to eat American owned Swiss Chocolate than (closest comparison) Kiwi made Whittakers.

Of course it does.

The solutions? 

Buy local. Don't ever buy it from Colesworth.",1751077155.0,2025-06-28T02:19:15+00:00,81,t3_1lmb197,t3_1lmb197

Minimum wage for 40 hours a week in 2015 was $656.90 ([Fairwork Australia](https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/sites/wagereview2015/decisions/c20151_order.pdf)). This is the minimum wage after 1st July 2015.

Minimum wage for 40 hours a week in 2025 will be $948 ([Fairwork Australia](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/workplace-laws/annual-wage-review/annual-wage-review-2024-2025)). This will be the minimum wage after 1st July 2025, after a 3.5% increase.

This is a 44.31% increase in minimum wage over 10 years, you can double check the calculation [here](https://goodcalculators.com/pay-raise-calculator/) if you wanna.

My local spudsheds are now Jandakot and Spearwood.

They seem to be Tony's pride and joy. He does his filming in one, and lives round the corner from the other.

And the fruit and veg is almost always good. Really good.

But even when my local was Bentley, where sometimes the bagged stuff wasn't perfectly fresh, I had the capacity to pick up the bag and look at it.

Does it all look good? Are there soft or limp spots?Are the tops and tails crisp? 

Exactly the same way I'd check out fresh fruit and vegetables at IGA, Farmer Jacks, MCQ, my local green grocer, or the local farmers markets.

It's not a difficult skill.

And if I shop seasonally, all of those options are cheaper on fruit and veg than Colesworth. 

So, I call bullshit bots and trolls, mate.

The regular pile on about Spudshed selling rotten food at great expense just isn't true.

Denver is very progressive and liberal, along with the laws from legal rec weed, soon to be shrooms, legal gambling, no church liquor laws, access to abortion, etc. 

Based on your political leanings I believe you'll enjoy the culture of Denver. 

There are many local shops such as used book stores and quirky coffee shops. If you choose the right neighborhood, you can live ""car lite"" as many neighborhoods (the most densely populated) are the most walkable. 

If you want something quieter check out the suburbs, but you'll be missing some of the city life from 4-5 major sports teams, 2-3 first Friday art walks, art museums all over downtown next to other museums.

A cheaper option is Albuquerque, NM. Still pretty liberal and located in a liberal state. The problem with NM is that it's a blue state with red state problems. The state doesn't generate enough revenue to support itself. This lack of revenue makes for a lack of investment in needed infrastructure and little social safety net. The schools have long been among the worst in the country. Even if you don't have kids, this leads to a poorly educated workforce and neighbors. Good education solves a lot of problems, and bad education creates many problems.¬†

lwdz0lm,JohnLockeRocks,"You seem to be implying that you are quite knowledgeable on the subject of American economics and that the millions of Americans who just made Trump the next president, voting in a ""democracy"" are somehow more ignorant than you.  Maybe you weren't aware that our national debt is so massive that the interest payment alone is ready to exceed our entire military budget.  Maybe you don't know that massive government borrowing and spending has been the major cause of the crazy inflation we've been suffering for the past few years.  Maybe you would prefer to continue spending hundreds of billions of dollars (which are all borrowed, given that our government is already an estimated $34 trillion in debt) to continue our proxy wars in Ukraine and Gaza, causing the needless death of hundreds of thousands of young Ukrainians and Russians, and the mass murder of some 40,000 innocent children in Gaza.  Maybe you're unaware that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have already cost our nation an estimated $6 trillion.  Maybe you didn't know that these wars are almost entirely justified by lies invented by our government ""leaders,"" are motivated by the unquenchable greed of the Military Industrial Complex, and are effectively an extremely expensive way for our ""leaders"" to engage in the endless mass murder of innocent children and young people all over the world.  Maybe you didn't know that our country is on the verge of collapse exactly because the satanic religion which teaches that women have the ""right"" to murder their unborn children has led to the death of over 60,000,000 American children since Roe v. Wade, and that this has resulted in a dramatic aging of our population and the inversion of the pyramid, which previously had a broad base of working-age citizens, who fed into and made sustainable programs like Social Security, Medicare, Food Stamps, et cetera.  So the same people who preach the doctrine supporting the mass murder of unborn children, labeling it ""women's health care"" or ""reproductive rights"" want to now flood our country with millions of (generally poorly-educated) illegal immigrants from all over the world, to replace the 60,000,000 murdered unborn American children.  And you still seem to not understand that moving most of our industries to places like China, India, Taiwan, Mexico, et cetera, makes our nation poor (because we buy foreign-made goods much more than we export American-made goods) and enriches those countries which are actually making almost everything we buy.  We are on the verge of economic collapse because the wealthy elites in this country have sold us out by moving production to countries full of poor workers and therefore cheap labor.  If we don't undo that self-destructive arrangement, we basically continue to bleed wealth as a nation.  Our entire system will collapse unless we reverse globalism, bring investment and jobs back home, and stop mass murdering our unborn children.

mffmfze,EmmyCF,"unless your dog in particular has a medical problem and is prone to getting bloat, I don't see why the dog has to stay in a crate after eating. what i recommend is a snuffle mat, or other type of slow/puzzle feeder, feed her meals INSIDE the crate, with the door open, or closed if she accepts that. If she's still uncomfortable, keep making changes until it is comfortable for her. Come sit next to the crate until she finishes the food. High value rewards like a stuffed kong, all inside the crate. When she's done eating, or starts getting uncomfortable, just allow her to leave the crate. As long as she doesn't sprint, roll and jump around after eating, there is no reason why her stomach would flip. Go back to basics, make the crate super comfy, blankets, hidden treats, toys, stuffed animals. A blanket over top is nice it turns the crate into a den and makes a comfy hiding spot. This should have been done when she is a puppy, but maybe it's not too late. The crate should be a party for her.

mfg1wd3,pyrategremlin,"Reading your comments about the program has suggested it sounds like the program doesn't know what they're doing and has probably created this anxiety with the crate themselves. Pet corrector especially, I was told by my trainer, never use it for anything but breaking up a dog fight.  It is to stop immediate behaviors that are dangerous like dogs fighting or a dog approaching your dog aggressively.

I am very concerned that your dog is just genuinely terrified of its own crate because it has been taught that it's a negative space not a positive one.  Like everyone has said you need to go back to crate training basics.  This dog is seriously averse to her own crate it sounds like and I don't think it's anything you did outside of trusting your trainers to know what they were doing.

mfgk16a,Jmfroggie,"You are with a terrible program. 

No dog NEEDS to be crated after eating unless there‚Äôs a medical problem they‚Äôve been diagnosed with. If this dog has a medical problem, it should likely not be a Service dog. 

Whatever you‚Äôre doing,if this is new, is causing this. If the dog has been doing this since you got it this dog has behaved this way it‚Äôs entire life. NO GOOD TRAINER will tell you to bang on a crate or use a corrector when it comes to crate training. That is supposed to be a SAFE PLACE!  Not all dogs can be crated if they started out with a bad experience that wasn‚Äôt worked on immediately and sometimes that can never be fixed. 

If this dog has any hope, you have to start all over with it. If the program isn‚Äôt responding to you, then report it to someone, like a state representative or animal welfare person, and post bad reviews. There‚Äôs probably no way to get your money back. Getting a new trainer is going to cost you, but it‚Äôs probably the only way to save your service dog because I‚Äôm assuming that the crate training wasn‚Äôt the only thing they did wrong with this dog if that‚Äôs been their attitude with food and crates.

If you aren‚Äôt in danger of breaking your contract and losing the dog back to the program, then you should hire a dog behaviorist.

I exercise her before she eats and we don‚Äôt do anything super exciting after she eats for about half an hour (she is crate trained but I don‚Äôt put a timer on it.) Instead of taking the programs advice on how to prevent gastric torsion I would talk with your vet about it. There is a surgery they can do where they essentially sew the top of the stomach in place which completely eliminates gastric torsion. Bloat followed by torsion has a very high fatality rate, the stomach surgery cuts the fatality rate down to 50% instead of close to 100%. The breeders for my breed recommend getting the surgery done during the spay since they‚Äôre in there anyway it makes it not as expensive.

mfqxvz4,Willow-Wolfsbane,"They might have been treating *you* well (except for telling you in all seriousness to terrify your dog into silence, like some kind of Alpha theory bull or something, and insinuating that the car issues are somehow your fault, even though that‚Äôs 100% not true. They‚Äôve lied to you at least once, and once it‚Äôs happened it‚Äôs likely they‚Äôve lied about other things as well), but, and I say this with all sincere and empathetic honesty, it doesn‚Äôt sound like they‚Äôve treated your *SD* well. 

There‚Äôs no way (my opinion) they haven‚Äôt been fully aware of his car sickness for pretty much his entire life, sickness so bad that it has to be medicated sometimes and you had to retrain him in a positive way. That definitely implies to me that they were just shoving him into the car while they had him. And who knows what his two previous placements were like. 

How old is he? 

It‚Äôs not wonderful that you had to pay/raise the full $18,000 for a dog who will have a shorter career, a dog *you‚Äôve* had to exert significant additional effort to *retrain*, to fix what they‚Äôve caused. 

Virtually *no* mentally stable well-trained SD would fail out of even *one* placement, let alone *two*. This heavily implies that it‚Äôs not his fault at all, it‚Äôs Little Angel Service Dog‚Äôs fault for trying to shove a square peg into a round hole, to put it one way. His car sickness alone would have made him a Career Change Dog in other more reputable organizations. Forcing him into a crate (something they likely did with force, and for more than 45 minutes although this is just hearsay) for no reason at all is crazy, why on earth would a ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúreputable‚Äù trainer say he has to stay crated for 45 minutes when simply walking around the house has almost zero chance of causing him to get torsion and bloat? And to the point where they literally tell you to bang on the crate, when the only time that would work to keep him quiet would be if it scared him quiet, and he‚Äôd be waiting, completely wound up with nervousness and fear. And the *professional trainer*, who is *employed* by Little Angels Service Dogs, told you to do that. 

It‚Äôs all just‚Ä¶*throws up hands*. Just‚Ä¶.*imagine* what it‚Äôs like for a young dog to have their entire life in advanced training controlled by trainers like this one. 

You already have this SD, you‚Äôve already paid for him (or someone else/many someone‚Äôs have), and you probably couldn‚Äôt get a refund even if you wanted to, so you can‚Äôt say anything negative publicly about them for as long as your dog‚Äôs career lasts, but you should put serious thought into where your successor dog will come from. There *are* organizations that do psychiatric SD‚Äôs for civilians (I assume your is mobility/psych), and in 5 years when he‚Äôs close to retirement there will likely be more. Hopefully my org will have grown significantly in size by then. They do ‚Äúcombination‚Äù SD‚Äôs, at no cost. Just so you have the site to save for later, [this is them.](https://www.baysideservicedogs.org). They‚Äôve been extremely kind to me, and always answer any and all questions thoroughly and with complete transparency, including their training methods (very close to R+, but sometimes she will tell a dog ‚Äúno‚Äù, so she doesn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre fully R+. That‚Äôs the level of honesty they have). 

This is all just things for you to think about. When you stop being able to rely on your org for training advice, that‚Äôs basically admitting that they‚Äôre not at all a reputable organization. It‚Äôs possible that your SD might wash at some point, with the problems you‚Äôre already having to work through. It would be good to be somewhat mentally prepared for the possibility of him needing significant training at some point in the future (R+ is slower but tends to create more bombproof dogs in the end), expensive training you would have to pay for. 

Best of luck to you and your guy. I very much sincerely hope that things so well for both of you, and that he‚Äôs able to heal from what they‚Äôve done to him in his life.

mfr0xzt,Willow-Wolfsbane,"That‚Äôs‚Ä¶that‚Äôs simply *crazy*. Poodle-mixes only have a small chance of being low-allergy (though it always depends on if the person is allergic to the saliva, to dander, or both). This shows they have less knowledge about dogs than a google search could tell you. Poodle-mixes also have unpredictable temperaments, (combine that with the fact that no reputable golden or poodle breeder I‚Äôve ever heard of would sell a puppy to someone who is going to breed mixes, so you have lower quality breeding stock to start with), and you‚Äôre combining a breed that can have hip dysplasia and cancer with a breed that can have elbow dysplasia, and you have as much likelihood of creating a dog with the *worst* traits of both breeds as the best. 

Their coats also have the potential to be a nightmare to upkeep. They‚Äôre known for their anxiety, much more so than a purebred poodle or purebred golden. If they‚Äôd mailed a hair and saliva sample to that client for an allergy check (you get plenty shaved off every 4-6 weeks after all), there would have been no need for a failed placement in the first place. And it should have been clear by the end of Team Training if the child liked the dog or not. 

There is truly very close to zero reason for a program to ever breed poodle-mixes. Hearing about people who breed ‚Äúdoodles‚Äù because they think they‚Äôre low-allergy always gets me all riled up, please excuse my rant, ha. üòÖ It‚Äôs not at all directed at you.

They *so OWE YOU* at least a 4k reduction in her cost for her age alone (a career that‚Äôs a year short is a big deal when a dog only works for 5-7 years on average, and your SD very unfortunately isn‚Äôt well-bred. I very much recommend that you go to a vet who can do sedated X-rays of her elbows and hips and have them read by someone qualified to do an OFA score. It‚Äôs worth the money to know how long or short her career is likely to be. She‚Äôs at increased risk of early hip and elbow dysplasia along with cancer simply by being poorly-bred, meaning she‚Äôd be suffering) let alone knowingly (they definitely knew) giving you a dog that they‚Äôve abused and given fear problems both with the crate and the car. 

I feel so much sympathy for this poor dog. But, you clearly want to do right by her, and want to be a team long-term.

They don‚Äôt do very many poodles which is odd cause they would be better than a doodle.
They did inform us she has very mild hip dysplasia (we have the vet records to prove it not just on their word alone).

So long as she‚Äôs just walking and not going crazy, I don‚Äôt see why the quiet time HAS to be in the crate. It‚Äôs so cruel of them to suggest that you *bang* on it. I mean, I don‚Äôt know in what universe that would work (except in one where she always got a *worse* punishment after the banging, so she knows what happens next if she isn‚Äôt still and quiet, which is utterly terrible). 

Little Angels Service Dogs has matched *so many* poorly trained SD‚Äôs that from what I heard their BBB rating is going to be lowered, because so many people have had to literally sue just to get a refund. I‚Äôve personally talked to two who have had to threaten to sue (one of them actually DID have to) just to get the $16,000 the contract allows back. 

I‚Äôm glad your dog seems to be well trained and happy otherwise, but they have made a *lot* of their clients lives basically a living hell while they first pressure them to keep extremely poorly trained dogs that actually make their disability‚Äôs symptoms worse to the extreme for long enough that the refund part of the contract doesn‚Äôt apply anymore, and then attempt to refuse to give the refund even if they *do INSIST* on returning the dog within the 3 months time frame (I think that‚Äôs it). 

I have much empathy for what you‚Äôre going through. I very much hope that the advice from others here helps. When it comes to maintenance training you might want to start doing that a different way as well. Many programs are almost entirely R+ these days, it just makes for a very solid dog in the vast majority of cases when done right.

Dry japonica rice is cheaper (if tou compare it on quantity yielded) than boxed instant rice. I also grew up in a household with basics. I literally am living at the poverty line aka ssdi. The japonica rice I buy is about a dollar a pound.


¬†Thankfully theres a walmart nearby that has a college town nearby, so Asian foods are cheap. Most times I use distilled white vinegar (the bulk stuff) and white sugar. I make my mirin from scratch; it's close enough in taste that cornsyup made with brown sugar is a close substitute.

m47a6pz,Novel-Property-2062,"I have this happen with many providers (gastros in particular tend to be on high alert IME) but ultimately my saving grace is having a PCP who is willing to work with me as a palliative care case and will act as an advocate on my behalf to external providers/ER when necessary. Not sure about your location and potential limitations re: that but I would shop around for PCPs if you're able.

But ultimately they do have the ability/right to turn us down because it can be a threat to their license to both know that we are in a life threatening position and to have it on record that they A) acknowledged the severity and B) didn't do anything to follow up with that. But I've found having another doctor on board taking responsibility seems to make a fair number of them more amenable to providing non-IP support

For me finding a doctor that specializes in anorexia was a bit of a challenge, but even my GP helps me out with it. So your ED dr is disclosing your health information and calling up docs for you instead of giving you a referral? This raises alarm bells.

What are you looking for from another dr outside of your ed dr? Is this a medical practitioner or a therapist? What is it they aren't helping you with?

You can file medical malpractice claim, but you will need some coordination your ed dr

This whole thing thing sounds like a round of shitty and sus doctors. I hope you can find find someone that actually practices medicine!

j3h1ewn,emambrose,"I'm sorry if this comes off badly but here goes: whether or not you recover is your choice, there isn't going to be some special moment where you finally feel really to recover, where you want to gain weight. The only person who can change your thoughts around food and your body is you. Ik it's not that easy, but it is that simple. You can choose to eat, you can choose to try and be less negative about the way you look. It will feel horrible and wrong at first, but you have to fake it till you make it. No one can save you but yourself. If you hope you'll get better one day why not start now? Why put off real happiness any further? It gets worse before it gets better but if you put in the effort it will get better and you'll get to live your life. Ik eds are usually caused by other things as well so I'm not saying life will be perfect, but if you recover from this then you will have the headspace to work on and recover from other issues too (if you have them). Sorry if this doesn't help, I'm so so sorry you're going though this, I really really hope you choose to recover, you deserve to be happy. <3

Palliative care is focused on making you comfortable during severe illness, and can be used ALONGSIDE curative treatment (so they will still try to help you work through your illness, but they want to ensure your comfort during treatment). Hospice or end of life care is used near the end of life, and it‚Äôs for situations when curative treatment (trying to solve the problem, so to speak) is no longer happening. I obviously don‚Äôt know your specific circumstances with your treatment team, but generally speaking, palliative care doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôve given up hope üíû",1673190442.0,2023-01-08T15:07:22+00:00,138,t1_j3h06l6,t3_1069wv8

Stay in the right-hand lane; let the locals Initial D around you in the left lane.

As far as I understand things, in an at-will state, an employer can fire an employee for any reason or no reason at all, as long as the termination does not violate anti-discrimination laws or other legal protections, such as being fired for being pregnant or being fired due to the office not making reasonable accommodations for an established disability, then it is perfectly legal for a company to fire someone for so-called ""bad reasons."" If you have information that supports your post and shows that I'm in the wrong, please share it, because I'm perfectly OK with being in the wrong and saying so as long as I am able to learn something from it.

Some of my Googling inquiries into this gave me this from the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act:

>Protected classes include race, sex (including pregnancy), color, religion, national origin, age (40+), disability, and genetic information. Employers also cannot fire employees in retaliation for reporting discrimination or participating in investigations.

I'll also add that in a better world, you would be right, and that no one should be fired without decent and provable cause, but most of us in the US do not live in such a world.",1749579533.0,2025-06-10T18:18:53+00:00,1,t1_mx25isx,t3_1l80ehi

Posts and comments not following the rules will immediately be removed!

Have you tried using the search bar?  
Many questions are asked daily, and your question may have already 
been answered!  
If so, your post will be subject to deletion.

Please refer to the following commonly discussed 
topics:

1) No one can predict whether or not you will purge! 
Statistically, most people DO NOT purge.  
That is what the science and medical literature says.

2) No one can predict how long your purge will last 
nor when it could start. 
Be patient, the purge can be tough but so many people have gotten through it - 
you can too!
THE ABOVE APPLIES TO SIDE EFFECTS TOO.  QUESTIONS ASKING WHEN THE PURGE OR SIDE EFFECTS WILL START OR STOP
WILL IMMEDIATELY BE REMOVED AS THAT IS LOW EFFORT.

3)  Any questions related about dosage MUST include DOSE and WEIGHT(lbs or kg).  
Otherwise, that is considered LOW EFFORT and will subsequently be REMOVED.   

4)  Most people DO NOT relapse when Accutane is taken until cumulative dosage is reached.

5) HOWEVER, cumulative dosage is a guideline.  
Everyone is different.  Some may need more Accutane, and others may need less.  Your dermatologist 
evaluates you as an individual.  
This also applies to your prescription.  Everyone is different, so no comparing of doses or asking why your dose is low or high.
If you do not trust your dermatologist, you should find a different one.

6) When in doubt, please consult a medical 
professional(dermatologist, doctor, pharmacist).  
DO NOT solicit medical advice from this subreddit.

It's all WATER RETENTION WEIGHT, you're body is carrying anywhere between 10-20 lbs of WASTE  and or WATER WEIGHT due too HIGH SALT and HIGH SUGAR HIGH CARB consumption.

If you can do it only sugar free drinks and the next 48-72 hours or until you're no longer bloated, 

Myself I can't have cheat meals only 1 cheat day a week, and I fast for 40 hours 3 days out of the week basically every other day.  

On the days that I eat I am under 100 carbs a day, 1700-2500 calories 
with 60 minutes cardio with weights 30-60 minutes.

That way any 'damage"" done over the weekend is undone by mid week low carb and or keto diet.

meyvp67,Professional_Cod8198," I‚Äôve been working on this myself, and I‚Äôve realized that impulse spending is really my brain searching for dopamine. The excitement of making a purchase feels great in the moment, but once I get home and open it, the feeling disappears‚Äîit‚Äôs just there, and there‚Äôs no real emotional attachment anymore.

I mentioned this in another comment, but I created a personal ‚ÄúDopamine Menu‚Äù with different activities that give me the same feeling as making an impulsive purchase. This has helped me not only curb impulse spending but also improve my patience in everyday situations.

When I‚Äôm out and feel like shopping, I do a self-check-in before buying anything:

How do I feel in this moment?

What is the purpose of this purchase?

How long will it actually serve me?

Do I need this now, or can it wait?

If I still want to shop, I go ahead, but before checking out, I go through my items and decide what I really need vs. what I just want. If I still want something but don‚Äôt need it, I put it back and tell myself: If it‚Äôs still here next time and I still want it, I can get it then. This helps cut down on impulse buys without making me feel restricted.

I also turned it into a reward system to make it more fun! If I know I have a task or responsibility I‚Äôve been procrastinating, I use an item I want as motivation. I made a list of rewards ranked from small to big, depending on the task. For example:

Big task (taking bottles to the depot) = I can get a new T-shirt.

Small task (putting my laundry away) = I can grab a Slurpee from 7/11.

This was a lot, lol, but I‚Äôve definitely noticed improvement! I‚Äôm still figuring things out, but these strategies have helped me manage impulsive spending better.",1740608874.0,2025-02-26T22:27:54+00:00,1,t3_1iyrxso,t3_1iyrxso

In group they talked about binging on something because you feel you might never get it again instead of savouring it and remembering it will last longer if you don't eat it all in one sitting. When you eat it all in one go you don't really get to enjoy it. Slow eating is important for this to work

-  Anxiety? Sadness? Fear?
I mainly ask this because I noticed a pattern for me, being that in the past when I would overeat and binge, it was also due to an overwhelming feeling that I felt, sometimes fear of ""OH NO DON'T DO THAT"" so by me starting my day off and telling myself not to binge, but just distract- it prevented me from actually allowing myself to just let the feeling of anxiety pass when it felt ready to pass, but instead I tried to control it by ""Distract, distract distract""
Lately instead I've just been simply laying down on the floor- which may sound odd to some, but once I lie down and just let the feeling pass rather than trying to distract myself, I give myself a hug and tell myself out loud that "" I am safe"" and feel much better afterwards.",1736555819.0,2025-01-11T00:36:59+00:00,1,t3_1hya6i3,t3_1hya6i3

Unless they have also struggled with BED, there is no possible way for them to understand that their comments hurt more than help. I assume they are, most likely, trying to be helpful because they are concerned about your well-being. Try to sit them down and explain, but assume they are attempting to help and it may make it easier to discuss.

m5n6y5p,Psychological-Back94,"To be blunt, your eating habits and body is not anyone‚Äôs business. I find it‚Äôs best not to discuss my poor relationship with food with others with the exception of online groups such as this or a therapist. It‚Äôs important to know your audience. Be mindful of who you‚Äôre vulnerable with. Many a times I wish I could have taken back my words. I‚Äôve lived and learned now so I‚Äôm more discerning with whom I share personal information with. Openly telling people about personal things like disordered eating is basically giving them ammunition. 

If your family, friend or coworker has never struggled with BED then they‚Äôll never understand it and therefore lack empathy. This makes them more likely to secretly judge and criticize and/or openly make inappropriate suggestions or comments because they can‚Äôt relate. Also, some people can be insensitive when it comes to weight, especially being overweight weight, because there is such a stigma. 

In the past when I had shared I was wanting to eat healthy and make better choices I found them watching what I was eating. Literally watching an monitoring. They would then question my choices and make unnecessary comments. 

That said, I do think you need to tell them firmly that your eating habits and body are not open for discussion. Period. Don‚Äôt go in to detail and elaborate. Just be blunt and to the point.

m4yx54b,salty_peaty,"It's not because you binged on the first of the year that you're doomed to binge during all 2025. The first day of the year doesn't have more power than any other day, it's one day among the other. So yes, you binged, no matter if it happened on January 1st or on another date: the day after is still a new one and you still can act on it and do your best to not binge again, to take care of yourself.

This is a part of fighting against the all-or-nothing mindset: the first day of the month/week is symbolic, you can make decisions at any moment, even during the day. And it's the same for the food: healthy/good/clean/safe food VS healthy/bad food only fuels food obsession and scarcity mindset. Or having to do X amount of exercise each day whereas sometimes you can have a rest day or do a little less.

""The best is often the enemy of the good"": wanting to make things perfect and considering that if it's not perfect then it's a failure is discouraging and only causes a ""lost for lost"" attitude which makes things worse and not trying anymore. So you binge yesterday, but now yesterday has ended, it's close, so focus on today. And even if what you do isn't perfect, remember that every effort has an impact, every step counts even if it doesn't lead you where you wanted to go. So do your best, evven if it's not perfect: at least you try and you can't regret this!",1735797185.0,2025-01-02T05:53:05+00:00,3,t3_1hrgj60,t3_1hrgj60

loylice,No-Break753,"lets do some basic maths. the 10 pound you gain is 4.5 kilograms. you ""binged"" due to what you say and ate 5-6, lets say it 6000 calories a day for 2 days.

it makes 12000 calories total. lets think like you have no more calorie need than average people and need 2000-2500 a day. lets say it 2000 calorie.

12000-4000=8000 is your surplus.

7000 calories makes 1 kg fat. so it is obviously impossible to this 4.5 kg to become completely fat but small amount of it is fat it seems. still significant but not like you describe.

the rest weight you took comes from water weight. it means you certainly restricted calories (especially carbs) to lose water weight you have in your muscle previously.

so you are RESTRICTING calories for most of the week successfully, just a dream for average BED people to achieve. they literally eat all the day and week.

also because of their disorder, their bmi is much more than your near underweight bmi (22) before weight gain and after still okay (25)

you have no BED, you restricted calories most of the week and said it ""not bingeing"" (it is restricting) and due to extreme hunger you ate lots of food for 2 days to compensate what you lost all week.",1727318041.0,2024-09-26T02:34:01+00:00,1,t1_loyfz2i,t3_1fpk6ib

Here's what worked for me!

>**Lower your standards**

Stop trying to restrict food, just try to eat like a normal person (like have 2-3 meals a day without bingeing). If you binge, that's okay - don't try to compensate by restricting again. Just try to eat like a normal person the next day and so on.

I wouldn't suggest restricting until you can do that for at least a few weeks. I'd also avoid weighing yourself because that's just going to make you binge.

>**Slowly decrease your intake**

If you can do that for a few weeks, you can then start to SLOWLY lower your intake. Slowly is key, because otherwise you'll just be back where you started. If you do binge again, don't try to compensate for it. Raise your intake. If you try to compensate for a binge, you'll end up back in the same cycle.",1743825531.0,2025-04-05T03:58:51+00:00,18,t3_1jru28t,t3_1jru28t

It's clear that you recognize that those ideas are problematic and you don't want to be thinking and feeling that way. That's a huge difference from actual transphobes who 100% believe that stuff and think it's good and right to hate on trans people.

As for the discomfort: well, yeah, if you're questioning your gender identity it would make total sense that trans characters would make you feel uncomfortable. Because *if* you're trans (and IMO non-binary definitely counts as trans), then that has a bunch of implications for your life. It would mean that you likely need to change a *lot* of things from how they are now. And that sounds difficult and scary. It's not the easiest prospect to consider for your future.

So when you see trans characters, they would remind you that there's this huge uncertainty hanging over you because you haven't yet figured out your gender identity. And yeah. That's gonna make you uncomfortable.

Personally, I doubt that the discomfort is about the characters themselves or even about them being trans. The discomfort is about *you* not having figured yourself out.

So do that. Do some [careful gender questioning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e3Vkh7HMEYxaXdDsVE92vfnh-DmkU6it/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113347782214491743878&rtpof=true&sd=true) and see where you land.",1754073156.0,2025-08-01T18:32:36+00:00,2,t3_1mf0yyq,t3_1mf0yyq

Nonbinary representation is getting better - broader, more humanising, but I still react to it with a fear that was implanted in me by growing up in a society where nonbinary people are rarely taken serious, and often mocked. I am still living partially closeted because I can‚Äôt properly face the fear of getting that sort of reaction to something so important to me.

Do you think it could jealousy of seing a character going through the journey of transitioning while you didn't ?

Simultaneously oldest and newest, Sharena Starshade. Warcraft night elf OC.

She's one of my oldest OCs ever in the sense that I always liked night elves since I was introduced to Warcraft and had a rough concept of an OC going around Azeroth and getting into trouble, with appearance based on one of the official arts.

But fleshing her out as a proper character, assigning her a place in the official Warcraft stories that I've played through (spoiler: mainly NSFW) and getting a commissioned art specifically for her is a recent development.

Kizakia/Hate Is my personal most recent One.

He's an almost 1000 Ghost of a 12 year old possessing Oren's body (so yeah, this technically Isnt even him but Just Oren's body being corrupted by him, signified by the dark green markings on his chest and the horns)

His race, the luxian, was almost wiped out by crusaders during the 10th century ad when they discovered their Island. Despite being peaceful, They were instantly targeted because they were a race of human that evolved with horns, so they were seen as demonic.

After dying in the genocide, Kizakia's hate for humans (despite being half human himself), was so great that his Spirit lived on. He spent centuries as a Shadow, unable to interact with the world directly, but before actually dying, he vowed to return when the next human/luxian Hybrid Will be burn and use them to finally uleash the power he accumulated during the centuries and kill every single last human on the Planet so that the luxian race Will never be targeted again (also Simply because of Resentment) and renamed himself ""Hate"" so that he never forgets the reason he's ""Alive"".

During these centuries, children were the only ones able to see him. He's actually the reason for the creation of many fairytales and myths surrounding Shadow creatures. The Boogeyman, l'uomo nero, Babau, El cucuy, etc.

Then Oren was Born (hybrid) and yap yap yap, Hate started to appear in his Dreams and eventually managed to possess his body.

Don't worry tho, he got beat down hard and KINDA became an ally. Oren's relationship with Kizakia Is kinda like Yuji itadori and sukuna if sukuna was a salty 12 year old edgelord that played League of Legends (Yes, Kizakia once possessed Oren's body Just to play LOL for an entire night)",1753289295.0,2025-07-23T16:48:15+00:00,2,t3_1m7d4sc,t3_1m7d4sc

Finally I read about the method where you put acne cream with benzoyl peroxide over the dark spots and let the LPS sit in a sunny spot, I used my window. Let her sit for a day and washed, repeated same process again then finally that worked. However it didn't immediately work which was weird.

So using it might be overkill. But then again if you use the sun then you stand a good chance of lightening the spots at least. 

But benzoyl peroxide has the chance to bleach the plastic over time. Some people forget to mention that. 

Instead of a magic eraser, since you might not be able to buy them, you could try looking for products made of melamine foam/sponge (which is the base for the eraser itself). Or you could try cif cream cleaner if that‚Äôs a brand that is carried around you (but if not you could probably find a product that is comparable to it). 

Any slightly abrasive cleaner (like a grit cleaner) might work as well. You could even try a facial cleanser with beads in it for exfoliation since this is likely surface dirt that needs to be lifted. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely sunk too deep into the plastic.

The lemon can be over powering honestly even if you put a little bit . So I'd suggest scrambling your eggs to try it and even then I'd sprinkle a little. It was an idea to try it but lemon pepper at least in my opinion requires food that has a strong flavor it's self so it's not over shadowed by the lemon in the seasoning . Like refried beans and chili together but even then it can out do the flavor so just have to be careful with how much you put like very careful.

I also started it for the purpose of weightloss however I advise you to be careful with fasting if you don't plan on doing it forever as it can be quite tricky. I lost near 30kg but sadly gained about 18 back as I didn't really learn about portion control and when you're not fasting and continuesly eat, even if its just snacking you stop fat burning which makes it easier to gain. I hope you hit your targeted weight but my reccomendation is that after hitting it don't immediatly stop fasting and instead decrease the amount of hours you fast and try to eat 3 meals a day with propper amount of portions and maybe learn about calories a bit to stop the possibility of overeating small but calorie dense food. Omad is good but switching from omad to normal eating its really easy to overeat especcially junk food.",1749924339.0,2025-06-14T18:05:39+00:00,1,t1_mxrzgt0,t3_1lbcpz0

Then there were her presents. Nothing aimed at a 7 year old, no toys or anything a 7 year old would like, just Georgie telling her that everything is organic cotton - that fact is meant to thrill a 7 year old? 

It was Georgie's day to wear a fancy new dress and be a princess for a day? She spent more money and thought on finding that dress than she did on all she bought for Karma.

And then the food. Karma wanted a matcha cake. Of course she didn't. Karma doesn't drink matcha, it is Georgie's drink!! It was all for Georgie and their ""cookbook"".  Karma wanted pizza and mac and cheese for her birthday meal. The mac and cheese was the only treat she had. Though she was given a spoonful and Koa was given the bigger portion that he asked for, but they were told they could have seconds.

She would put flavored seasoning in the popcorn she'd pop herself  so her logic about trying to avoid artificial flavorings and chemicals didn't make sense.  She said that stuff would KILL us.

However, he isn't just a guest or friend, he's literally family. Therefore he's part of the legacy and is entitled to some of the wealth.


If all the Cattons die, Farleigh and his mom were next in line. But because they got cut off, Oliver takes over, and the family line was destroyed. Wealth they had hoarded for generations, all went to some random guy.

Feelings aren't always logical so while Farleigh benefits greatly from the Cattons, I understand why he bristles that they don't care about the plight of his mother.  Money aside, he probably feels as they open their home to anyone, why shouldn't his mother be extended the same courtesy and relieve some of her financial worries by at least letting her have a place to live.  And while we do not see the day to day slights Farleigh may suffer at the hands of the Cattons, we did get a scene where one of the footmen gave him a knowing look which implies there is a history of Farleigh being the recipient of  unequal treatment.   While they treat him like the member of the family he is, the fact that Sir James kicked him out so swiftly after the Palissy plates issue means, really, he's just a step up from a house guest that they can dispatch of when they're through with them, like Poor Dear Pamela.",1735879172.0,2025-01-03T04:39:32+00:00,10,t3_1hsdcfi,t3_1hsdcfi

m5zm7x9,Relevant_March_6799,"Farleigh deserved to be grateful and not too entitled. You thought that wrong. That‚Äòs just my honest opinion. You‚Äôre  right about everything  you said but Farleigh is not a bully to Oliver, and Farleigh is a cousin of Venetia and Felix. He and Oliver are friends who didn‚Äòt bring the animosity, there was some reject, resentment, mistrust, trials, and tribulations. They love each other as friends but it‚Äôs hopeless because of Oliver‚Äôs dark mind. Sometimes, it‚Äôs hard to trust people who have the right to never feel bad for this black man which can be racist. Maybe I‚Äôm not quite ready to trust your topic. You continue to make excuses about what‚Äôs right for you about the Farleigh hate. The hate isn‚Äôt important and is dehumanizing to most people. It‚Äôs a new year. He‚Äôs human, he made mistakes and so do we. He‚Äôs been going through the painful circles and it keeps repeating and wants to forget it. Forgetting the pain can be traumatic for him which what he did in the movie and he deserved his big pain that he‚Äôs been dealing with.

It‚Äôs not Farleigh‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs the Cattons that pushed the absolute limits which Farleigh breaks the points. He knew what their problem is. Of course the Cattons took care of him but they seem to never do their accountability for him and the others. That does mean bad things continue to happen in Saltburn. But that does explained Farleigh‚Äôs remorse and guilt. Most people like me felt bad for Farleigh so you don‚Äôt have to.",1736305467.0,2025-01-08T03:04:27+00:00,1,t3_1hsdcfi,t3_1hsdcfi
mgefag1,Relevant_March_6799,"Another thing. Most of us objected that Farleigh is a bully but we all know that he‚Äôs isn‚Äôt even getting his glory of what he wants as a black man. He can be serious, pathetic, awful, and viscous, but those are the parts of his life. If I was him, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to invite them back for destroying my security, heritage, household, trust, and care but I still love them regardless. You maybe think that he is a bully and an awful person, but he isn‚Äôt. You hated him for being a rich man to hurt a poor guy but that‚Äôs a total lie. Oliver is wealthy from the middle class and Farleigh is poor from the low class. This wasn‚Äòt meant that Farleigh is awful, Oliver is and we agree. Your mind is screwed up! This movie is screwed up. The haters are screwed up. Mistakes are still continuing. Oliver is a perpetrator, not a victim. That‚Äôs the truth! I‚Äôm not a narcissist, I‚Äôm chilled. It‚Äôs just that you‚Äôre not ready for change. I accepted my ways.

Farleigh maybe tall, dark, strong, foolish, ignorant, intelligent, entitled, arrogant, successful, and lustful. Guess what, he ain‚Äôt like any other villain. He did some things he shouldn‚Äôt have been doing, he isn‚Äôt who he really is. It happened. A good guy who made bad mistakes he‚Äôll learn from. A neutral figure. I complicated Oliver, I detested Felix and the Cattons, I trusted Duncan and Venetia, I condoled Pamela, and I forgave Farleigh. Farleigh had no choice but to hurt or threaten Oliver for ruining his hospitality and causing chaos to the house after Oliver framed him out. I know he‚Äôs scared but he has to do it by giving him a harsh lesson. I was scared of Farleigh before and we all were scared of him that he‚Äôll destroy Oliver. Bullying Oliver‚Äôs evil manipulation, lies, and summer fantasy is what Farleigh is doing. He fought Oliver‚Äôs fire with his own fire. Still, Farleigh isn‚Äôt a bully who deserves to bully Oliver‚Äôs evilness once. He still loved Oliver so much but he hated what Oliver has done, that‚Äôs why Oliver needed to be straighten but he refused.

Oliver still wanted Farleigh out since he found out that the Cattons are covertly toxic and racist to him. This isn‚Äôt a fuck you to him. Yes Oliver did some stupid and disgusting stuff to get their attention and he made poor choices, using his poor choices were weaponized to kill the family, his poor choices became his rich choices ever since. Oliver truly accepted himself as an awful person and bully to the Cattons he loved and then hated. He only loved and felt bad for Farleigh, so do I. Oliver won‚Äôt let Farleigh come back to them or he‚Äôll be WICKED to hang on.

It‚Äôs true for Oliver that Farleigh doesn‚Äôt belong to Saltburn because the Cattons‚Äô and they used him as a marketing tool to bring them entertainment, specifically finding Oliver‚Äôs true nature instead of exposing him. Farleigh demanded help, respect, love, and accountability from them but the Cattons destroyed everything. Farleigh is a protector of Saltburn and the reality‚Äôs innocence who accepted his guilt, not money, will, or validation. Farleigh is the real humane character we RESPECT! Oliver isn‚Äôt since there‚Äôs no way he could do that for Felix after all the lies he said.

if you keep hating or disliking me and the others, why did you do this to me? Overall, you don‚Äôt have to hate me for jumping into your righteous debate. If you continue to be that way negatively against me and my right, that‚Äôs fine, that‚Äôs your self defense but still it‚Äôs your problem.

When Sir James died, all of his estate would have gone to Elspeth. Oliver then manipulated Elspeth to leave everything to him.

In this scenario, Farleigh wouldn't really be able to fight for anything because he *had* no right to the money.

I never touched a scratcher for most of my life and associated them with other vices and saw them almost as something to be ashamed of.


In ASIAN cultures, however... It's totally different. They're very used to gifting each other money, or money-like objects like scratchers (that's another thing, in ""white"" culture giving money to someone as a gift is diminutive and can only be done from elder to minor. In Asian culture it's expected to give money no matter what).


Anyways, I've gifted Asian in-laws scratchers for birthdays and other random events and it's almost better than receiving money to them. It's thoughtful, they love it, not weird, etc.

Me and my husband are so much more chill with our kid than all of our parents. Our parents try to be strict with our kid and the results are all suboptimal. My mom came to visit and within a month became the bad guy because she was very strict about everything. And the reason she was like that is because that's just her personality. She also gave our kid a lot of candy and sweets, and that was mostly to bribe her into behaving whenever grandma was in charge. My MIL takes my kid out and lets my kid cry when she's doing her shopping. I let some of it fly. But mostly my kid's grandparents are all-at-sea when it comes to taking care of her and do whatever they can. It's ""easier"" in that I'm not really holding them accountable all that much and they get to hand her back to me, but they still are thinking on their feet trying to manage my kid, and also have the added stress of worrying if I'd disapprove of something they did.

Is a customer telling you they want to start being an adult and paying their bills and figuring their shit out? Maybe an investment account or savings account would be in order. Did somebody mention they need that nsf because times have been tough? Maybe they need to see about speaking to a credit specialist to see if you can free up some extra money each month.

kom2c81,MethanyJones,"At the big banks they're filling openings with H1B's who work cheaper than citizens and are easier to control. When they post a job a contractor is already doing that job, it's not truly a vacancy.  Frequently the incumbent contractor gets converted to FTE. They're just documenting that they've interviewed others to check a box.


The stagecoach bank is legendary for doing interviews just for the sake of creating a thicker recruiting file.  In most cases they've identified an internal candidate for their posting.  In some cases the verbiage in the posting is tailored to the internal candidate's resume.


I would caution you against trying to get in as a contractor. Hiring on as a contractor and converting is a valid path but it's going to be painful.  


The one thing that Tata, Infosys, Virtusa, Larsen& Toubro, and Wipro all have in common is they are spectacularly bad to work for.  They are ultra-bureaucratic and very rigid.  You will likely have an onshore ""boss"" that works in the same office as you and also an offshore boss.  Your offshore boss is likely to be a disorganized sociopath - he was good enough to get hired there but not good enough to ship overseas.  They will play good cop/bad cop with the offshore one delivering all the bad news.  After about three months working for one of them I stopped answering those phone calls from India... 


There's no upward mobility in such a role, no growth path and fat chance you'll ever get a raise.  What's the sociopath in Mumbai going to do if I don't take his calls? Not give me a raise?

Your natural waist is 24‚Äù so you‚Äôre quite slim so it‚Äôs hard to reduce your waist by 6‚Äù - especially in one go. Typically the recommendation is to go for a 4‚Äù reduction for your first corset. It takes time to get used to that so it‚Äôs recommended to not tighten it too much.

kefp2xf,Nicole-Bolas,"okay, I think it makes sense that this was painful for you then! The rib spring on a novice is 6.5in and the hip spring is 10in. With your measurements, if you want to wear an 18, you'd need rib spring of 9.5in and hip spring of 12in when closed. So if you're feeling totally squished that's why! Also, I find that corsets (at least on me) tend to ""squish"" me so I appreciate a bit of extra rib / hip spring to accommodate that. It's not as if your body is magically disappearing, after all; it's just being compressed a bit and redistributed. 

All of that being said, I'm not sure why you'd start to feel really tortured if you've got a 4 inch lacing gap in that corset. I wonder if you're tightening the laces evenly top and bottom and not just tugging the middle? I also wonder if you aren't just already quite small and don't have much ""squish"" (subcutaneous & internal fat) to redistribute with a corset. The corset may also be too long, or putting pressure on your hips, or putting pressure on your floating ribs (which can hurt quite a bit). Either way, I would back off from pain for sure, and maybe try other brands. Orchard isn't good brand but mystic city can probably find you a corset with the measurements you need above, plus a reasonable length that may work better for you. I personally find that the underbust-to-waist vertical length is rather long for my body in Timeless Trends; Mystic City has much smaller measurements in that realm (down to 3.5"") which can be much better if your hips or waist are the problem.",1703227964.0,2023-12-22T06:52:44+00:00,3,t1_kefi48g,t3_18o1cd4

kc8s59t,AlexaFaie,"Definitely speak with your doctor about it as they will be able to offer suggestions on what you would need from a corset to help support your back. Discussing them as a breathable fabric alternative to a back brace could help there. Some people do have luck being able to order off the rack in the case of minor scoliosis, others require a custom made piece (which might be asymmetric to fit some degree of curve left-right). 

Knowing the kind of corset you'd require would help you narrow things down as if it needs to be a medical corset then there are only a set number of people who are experienced making medical corsetry in the world. Its even possible that your doctor (if you are in America) could prescribe you a medical corset as a back brace and insurance may cover the cost. But basically if your doctor thinks you need a *corrective* device then you will definitely need a medical corset custom made e.g. you might need continuous boning, or straps, or a pattern that deliberately forces you into a straighter postion. Those would all require a custom piece. 

If its just for support to maintain where you are at now & preventing things from progressing further then that might allow for more choice so if your doctor thinks either a more regular custom made corset or an off the rack corset could be suitable then there could be lots more options. And others have already mentioned good brands & places for more info. 

I would avoid Orchard Corset as their patterns are not anatomically shaped in that they don't curve outwards to cup the hip and have been known to cause nerve pinching/permanent nerve damage due to this. They're also not very consistently made - sometimes the sides measure completely different from the other or they otherwise do not match the size info at all, often having less space in tge hip than quoted. And the construction quality from a strength perspective is bad too. If you are going to be wearing a corset daily, theirs will wear out stupidly (seams tearing, bones wearing through) fast making them get expensive really fast.

One thing I do know is that the firm plastic back braces that people with scoliosis are often prescribed tend to have waist reduction simply as part of what makes them functional - it helps anchor the corset on your body. Commonly this is around 2"" to 4"", but there have been cases where long term wearing has meant a patient's next brace is made smaller in the waist because they have inadvertently reduced their waist size & their other one fits a bit loose! So depending on your starting size a corset ordered 6"" down might be fine even for medical usage (particularly if you'd be wearing it with a 2"" gap). But it could also be Orchard Corset's terrible customer service which frequently recommends the wrong size & shape for people just to make a sale.",1701880046.0,2023-12-06T16:27:26+00:00,5,t3_18c4fo5,t3_18c4fo5

kc898ni,MothraAndFriends,"I would start out by finding your fit, rather than worrying about the brand. Because a brand could be very very good, but still have nothing whatsoever in your proportions. Check out Lucy‚Äôs Corsetry if you don‚Äôt know much about corsets. She has compiled a website with a huge amount of information, including info on corsets and back issues and how to find your size and how to get your correct measurements. 

A six inch reduction isn‚Äôt always a six inch reduction. For reasons that are hard to explain to a new person, but will make complete sense to you once you know more about corset fits, some people might buy a six inch reduction corset and wear it at only a four inch reduction, rather than buying a four inch reduction corset - it all has to do with how the corset fits the rest of your measurements, not just your waist, but your hips, underbust, and bust, if you are getting an overbust. Additionally, six inches is a huge reduction to someone with a tiny waist, or an athletic build; whereas on someone with a larger circumference waist, it can be a very modest reduction. 

Because I don‚Äôt know anything about your proportions, I can only make the following recommendations: get yourself some education, Lucy is one person, and there may be some other reputable enthusiasts on YouTube, or those who own a corset shop and have educational materials on their website. Measure yourself. Consider your budget. If you can, getting a custom corset is a no brainer in your situation, since you can just ask them for what you want in your size and preferred waist reduction and they will be aware of where your scoliosis is and which direction. They will make you the most comfortable and supportive corset for daily wear. If you don‚Äôt want to take that dive, once you have your measurements, you can do some smart shopping, and people on this sub will be able to help you  - if you post your measurements and the corsets you are considering, people will tell you if they are likely to be a good fit and why.",1701872343.0,2023-12-06T14:19:03+00:00,1,t3_18c4fo5,t3_18c4fo5

Many people have very slight scoliosis, if you have a fairly significant curve and you‚Äôre very uneven, getting a custom piece made by someone familiar with medical corsetry might be the most ideal but getting a well made, close fitting off the rack corset may work too. while I don‚Äôt mind a few of my Orchard corsets (and they‚Äôre considered grey or black listed in certain suns and circles) they are certainly not sturdy enough for my scoliosis and back issues. The front and back are not sturdy enough and they‚Äôre more prone to twist on my body, warp and don‚Äôt offer as much support.

he6c4vg,jRoxy13,"That‚Äôs very common with pearl and frost finish polishes. It‚Äôs not just you!

If you are very good and quick, you can do a final thin coat over and really float your brush on the top, keeping it straight and steady, to minimize the lines. 

The best way is to use a sponge tip applicator (think the cheap ones included in drugstore eyeshadow palettes) or you can cut up cosmetic wedges but I prefer the precision of the applicator. Saturate the sponge with polish and then sponge over the nail (the polish should already be built up to opaque before this). That eliminates the lines from the pearls in the formula and applying a quick-dry top coat over this layer while still wet melts the sponge texture. 
 
An example of frost with normal application: [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/iN5zhWUabaQvzHWt6). 

Here‚Äôs the same polish, but I applied it with the sponge method: [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/TLFov8vW19Z8dV7MA).

Edit: I forgot, but you can also try the neon application method. That‚Äôs where you apply polish over a matte top coat (dry) to minimize streaks. This could help with frost polishes, but I‚Äôve never personally tried it.",1632539126.0,2021-09-25T03:05:26+00:00,7,t3_puv133,t3_puv133

Personally, I don't mind some brush strokes, it's another layer of interest to me, though I get why some folks dislike them.

If you've got ridges and bumps, you may want to look at getting a ridge filling base coat...it'll help smooth the surface of your nail for a smoother end result.",1632526753.0,2021-09-24T23:39:13+00:00,3,t3_puv133,t3_puv133

h77q7n5,gluconeogenesis_EVGL,"I used to suffer from recurring nightmares, but I found the cure.  Could help you.

&#x200B;

First, the most important thing is to realize you're dreaming / in a nightmare again.  Try to get control of your gaze and look down at your hands.  Your hands will always be there in a dream, and they'll help you focus.

next, take a short glance up, and then back to the hands if you can.  The idea is to find any specific object in your nightmare.  Then look back at it, and focus on it.  Zoom in on it, move towards it and into the object.  In a school setting a clock or a bright light or a chalkboard would all be good common objects, but it can be literally anything.

In a dream, every object is also another entire dream.  You'll enter the object and exit in a new dream.  For me, the first time I did this during a nightmare, I found myself in an 'ordinary' dream, fell deeply asleep, and the nightmare never came back.  If yours are recurring, you'll have lots of time to practice the above things, so don't worry about getting it all right the first time.",1627747448.0,2021-07-31T16:04:08+00:00,1,t3_ov891v,t3_ov891v

gvzekju,[deleted],"I hate some of the packaging for indie perfumes. I have a lot of thoughtfully packaged niche and designer perfume and I love admiring the bottles on fragrances that I enjoy wearing. It almost ruins a scent for me when I buy an indie online and it comes with a label on it that looks like it was designed by a 90s kindergarten teacher. I just got something from Ganache and it came with a label that might as well be comic sans (honestly comic sans would be better) and the flimsiest, cheapest clashing pink atomizer. It‚Äôs hideous. It also sprays weird. 

Having a distinct, off-beat style is one thing‚ÄîI think Smell Bent and A Lab on Fire have clever packaging for indies. Solstice Scents look good too. 

And yeah, Tea Rose has the worst atomizer. Best atomizer is probably Le Labo‚Äôs 50mL bottle. Really nice even spray. I also like the atomizers on Outremer‚Äôs Vanille and Oceane‚Äîfor cheapies they come packaged really well.
