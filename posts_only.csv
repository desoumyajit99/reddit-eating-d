Correct_Fig_6198,1mnj4p2,"I'm a Homebody, my Husband is Extrovert",True,"So over the weekend my husband expressed to me that I stay home to much and he would like to see me go out to do things and meet more friends. I tried to explain that working 40hrs a week plus taking on the majority of food burden and cleaning of the house & taking care of our dogs, leaves me exhausted and I also genuinely love being at home.

I also work out of the house which is a struggle for me so I yearn for the comfort and relaxation to recharge so I can do it all again the next week.

I actually hate that tiktok made the term bed rotting a thing bc he says I bed rot. Because I do chill in bed, but literally I am in bed then doing something like; cleaning, cooking, engaging with our dogs, watching youtube videos, reading books, playing video games, and just enjoying the peace of home.

I do have friends, they all have since moved out of state, but we still talk regularly and I feel like my social needs are met. But he wants me to find local friends to do stuff with.

My hobbies also include like self-care, cooking, baking, and my dogs. I am sober and honestly being out in public really gives me anxiety, which i am medicated for, but I have to really amp myself up to even return items at the store. I do a lot of grocery delivery and drive thru pick up as a way to help with my sensory overload which I'm sure he wishes I would just go to the store and get things but honestly this system works so much better for me.

Husband is a social guy and I always encourage him to go out and be with his friends. He will invite me but I do say no quite often. This is another thing that he wants me to suggest more activities for the two of us to do. Which I do! but I think with his ADHD he forgets.

BC I think it's relevant, I also have Depression & General Anxiety disorder which I am medicated for and it helps but I'm just not the wild party girl that I was when I was 20 or even 25! I'm almost 31 and I feel like he is missing the spontaneity? IDK

IDK I guess I am ranting and hoping for some anecdotal advice for my other AuHD baddies.

Correct_Fig_6198,1mjgz3t,Obligatory - Quitting the Pill(Nikki) Story and Updates if anyone wants them!,True,"To preface: I have diagnosed ADHD, Depression, & Anxiety. I also have migraines(just found out with aura) and I experience PMDD-like symptoms but have not been formally diagnosed. Medications include: Zoloft 150mg, Wellbutrin 450mg, Ritalin 10mg x2 a day.

I started Loryna Oct 2023, specifically for acne and migraines. Normally I only get a cystic zit around my period, but I had a crazy break out from Sept 2023 -> Feb 2024 and thats what prompted me to go back on BC, and this kind specifically.  (sidenote: the only thing that fixed my acne was Adapalene Gel every night) I have noticed about 5-10lbs of weight gain but I have been eating more in general to build muscle. Also the migraines have not improved with BC.

A few weeks ago I had a terrible Migraine and learned that my symptoms are consistent with Migraines with Aura(not the cool kind). With the new information my provider realized that I should not be on my BC Nikki/ Loryna/Lorena, and it's actually really bad. I had been on it for nearly two years prior. 

Obviously I am going to stop taking my current pill. My Dr advised OPill or Slynd which are progesterone-only pills, and I think instead, I will just quit BC. I was researching both and I don't want to risk it? 

I am definitely nervous about my skin and weight reacting bc those are huge anxiety triggers for me. My husband is neutral on being on or off the pill. He thinks whatever is best for me is best for 'us'. 

I know this post is all over the place, and chaotic but lmk if you need/want more info.

  
Here is my stats and I will try to come back with updates!

Day One: 125lb & Zero Acne for MONTHS. - Last migraine was over 2 weeks ago.

Entire_Weather3209,1motndw,My only real goal I have left is my ED now,True,"I‚Äôm not proud of it but it‚Äôs just the truth. I don‚Äôt even care about what I wanted my career to be because part of me thinks I won‚Äôt even finish what I need to do first before my body gives out on me

There‚Äôs only one other thing that I want in life and it‚Äôs not a goal I can work towards because it‚Äôs outside of me (just trust when I say it‚Äôs not something I can work towards, if you knew the goal you‚Äôd get it üò≠ )

Anyways, it‚Äôs just kinda sad sometimes. Like other people have these dreams in life that they‚Äôre excited about- and I‚Äôm over here focusing on hitting my UGW that won‚Äôt even make me happy.

I get it, recovery is always an option and people recover all the time. I know. And that‚Äôs awesome, I truly hope everybody is able to recover because I think it‚Äôs great. But I don‚Äôt even have that on my radar anymore, this just feels like part of my core now. I‚Äôd have an identity crisis, I feel like I need it. I know I don‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm not walking away, and that‚Äôs just the reality of it. I don‚Äôt know. I just feel like I‚Äôm watching myself drown in it and I‚Äôm allowing it, it is what it is I guess.

Entire_Weather3209,1mnej1s,So I think I‚Äôm in denial about my ED,True,"Just as a warning this is talking about my own insecurities when it comes to my ED diagnosis and feeling invalid which may be triggering- so just a heads up.

I‚Äôve struggled with bulimia off and on since I was 13 (I‚Äôm 25 now)- with small periods of BED but mostly it‚Äôs been bulimia or recovery.

This time though, I‚Äôm fully aware that I technically have atypical anorexia. I‚Äôve known for months- but.. it stings for me. So I still always refer to myself as bulimic anyways (is that offensive now by the way..? Like since I know I‚Äôm not an actual bulimic anymore..?). It just hurts my feelings in a weird way.. I just feel like when somebody hears ‚Äúanorexic‚Äù they automatically assume skinny- but I‚Äôm not yet. I do still purge like a bulimic.. I just don‚Äôt binge anymore.. and I have lost a lot of weight, but because of my starting weight this time I‚Äôm still not underweight which is a requirement to be a ‚Äútypical anorexic.‚Äù 

I‚Äôve heard other people also discuss their qualms with being considered an atypical anorexic but I‚Äôm not sure how many other people will deliberately still claim their past ED out of rejection of the new technical diagnosis.. for me it‚Äôs twofold because it is partially the fact that being called an ‚Äúatypical anorexic with purging tendencies‚Äù makes me feel super invalid compared to bulimia and also the fact that bulimia has been a large part of my life ED wise. I‚Äôm not usually a ‚Äúlabels‚Äù type of person when it comes to most things but because I‚Äôve struggled with it for so long bulimia feels like a part of my identity and it makes me feel weird to have that stripped from me- especially since I do still purge which I know most people associate with bulimia..

Anyways- I just feel like everything sets me off. I‚Äôll calm down soon when my body readjusts but I just hate when I get like this.

I don‚Äôt know.. it‚Äôll pass soon like I said when I readjust but it just sucks. Also the physical pains of it again are harder on me at the beginning so that sucks too.

I already had a hard time with it before my current relapse, but now it‚Äôs gotten significantly worse (to be honest I didn‚Äôt know it could till now- but here we are üò≠)

So I keep comparing myself to other people‚Äînot because I want to be them, but because I‚Äôm trying to figure out what I look like. Like: ‚ÄúOkay, they look like X, but their body shape is different‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôre the same height, so maybe I look kind of like that?‚Äù

At this point in my relapse, it‚Äôs automatic.

Entire_Weather3209,1mdlkyr,I wish people would stop commenting on my food..,True,"I don‚Äôt understand why people feel the need to comment on what I‚Äôm eating. Like if I said I ate x for breakfast, you don‚Äôt need to tell me how I should‚Äôve eaten x instead because it has more protein for the calorie count. It grates at me. Especially if the person KNOWS I have an ED. Like. Let‚Äôs be absolutely clear- I eat significantly less than I‚Äôm supposed to. I‚Äôve reached a point in my relapse where I don‚Äôt even hide it anymore. (Which by the way- in all my time of having an ED is very weird/unusual for me but I think I just don‚Äôt have the energy/care to pretend?) Why are you then trying to take away something I did feel comfortable eating? 

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a terrible attempt at trying to make me break out of my safe foods but it just doesn‚Äôt work. It feels counterintuitive, it upsets me, makes me feel like I‚Äôve failed and then I feel I have to rectify it by fasting/purging/both. I don‚Äôt even feel like my response of shame is abnormal for a person with an ED. I understand that a lot of people may not understand EDs in depth but come on. I feel like at the bare minimum that specifically shouldn‚Äôt have to be explained. It just really upsets me. 

Usually I just cry later and try to fix it. And then the person probably feels like they accomplished something because I‚Äôm too ashamed of myself to say much in response. When in reality I probably did exactly the opposite of what they wanted me to do in the end and they might have permanently made me lose a food I felt comfortable eating. I don‚Äôt know. I guess I‚Äôm just sensitive about my ED but it hurts my feelings and it honestly just feels to me as if it should be basic knowledge. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve noticed has happened with multiple people in my life and I just don‚Äôt get it. I know it‚Äôs not the case but sometimes it feels like they WANT me to get worse.

Entire_Weather3209,1m7lrfe,I have surgery tomorrow so I can‚Äôt purge for a couple weeks.. any advice to like help with the urge so I don‚Äôt do it while I heal..?,True,"So I just got back to my hometown and I had come here with the understanding that I was here primarily for surgery- but I assumed it would be at least a few weeks or something before it got scheduled. But nope. Surgery is tomorrow. I had kinda planned to slowly get myself used to not purging for a bit first so I‚Äôd be ‚Äúready‚Äù to transition while I heal- but I don‚Äôt have time for that now obviously.

I‚Äôm thinking of just lowering my intake significantly- I do know that‚Äôs not great for healing but I also know purging would probably be way more harmful. I just worry about eating more because every time I try to up my intake I just freak out and purge anyways. I don‚Äôt know what else to do- any advice..? 

Also- I think I might look fatter while I heal since there will be swelling during the recovery so any advice on coping with that aspect would also be appreciated..

I‚Äôm annoyed as hell- so.. I have an UGW and yesterday my scale glitched I guess (it‚Äôs not a scale I‚Äôm used to using), and it said I was BELOW my UGW. And I thought I‚Äôd be happy for at least a few minutes- BUT NOPE. I was immediately like.. what if I hit X weight instead? And then I was like NO WAIT- that‚Äôs just laziness- just think of all I‚Äôm capable of- I should really go for X weight! 

I‚Äôm so disappointed in myself for a multitude of reasons: first of all- I didn‚Äôt even hit my UGW and it was straight up delusional to think I had not only hit but that I was UNDER it already- granted I realized pretty fast it made no sense but still. (I am happy because I was less than I thought I would be but still majorly disappointing since, I am in fact, nowhere near my UGW üò≠). And second of all- I did know realistically that my UGW wouldn‚Äôt actually be satisfying for me because I‚Äôve been UW before and I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with it then either. BUT COME ON. I thought I‚Äôd have at least have a few minutes of peace. But no.

Now I was hoping if I truly understood this- then maybe- just maybe- it‚Äôd push me to finally start on that recovery journey again since I know I‚Äôm chasing the fallacy that this will grant me happiness- but nope.

Entire_Weather3209,1m5zhp3,I hate when people comment on my eating in any way,True,"So first of all I almost never eat in front of people but I got a comment that‚Äôs messing with my head a lot- it was from my dad who‚Äôs like the only person I really am okay with watching me eat and I get it‚Äôs probably from concern but it just makes me so self conscious.

We weren‚Äôt even eating together or something when he said it. It was just during a period of silence and he felt the need to say it.

Entire_Weather3209,1lwzdtz,I don‚Äôt know how to forgive myself for the damage I‚Äôve done to my body,True,"I‚Äôm so angry at myself. I‚Äôm confused about why I let it get this bad.

Some background: I have several serious medical issues that existed before my eating disorder got out of control. Two of the biggest are CVID (common variable immune deficiency ‚Äî meaning I‚Äôm immunocompromised but not contagious or anything) and UCTD (undifferentiated connective tissue disease ‚Äî basically early autoimmune disease that hasn‚Äôt fully declared itself yet). With UCTD, many people never even progress into full autoimmune conditions if they take care of themselves and manage stress. But I didn‚Äôt.

Instead, I relapsed.

And not just any relapse ‚Äî this has been the worst relapse of my life, starting back in September. During it, I refused to see doctors (except for one ear issue and the dentist), and I completely stopped all my medications. I told people I wanted to try ‚Äúnatural healing,‚Äù but that was a lie. I was terrified the medications would make me gain weight ‚Äî even though they didn‚Äôt have that side effect.

Well, now I don‚Äôt have UCTD anymore. It‚Äôs officially progressed into full-blown lupus (SLE). My rheumatologist also suspects I may have developed other autoimmune conditions, so I need more tests. Because, you know, my body just loves to keep it interesting. She told me to see an immunologist again and that‚Äôs coming up in a few days. After that, I‚Äôll do the rest of my testing all at once.

And I‚Äôm terrified of what they‚Äôll find.

My gastroenterologist also says I need an endoscopy. I‚Äôve put it off for a very long time. I‚Äôm scared to see what bulimia has done to my esophagus ‚Äî especially since I have a dysfunctional immune system. And now, I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôll need my appendix removed soon (not an emergency, but another thing on the list). I actually should‚Äôve already done it- but I‚Äôm not back in my hometown yet which is where I want to get it done. I was supposed to be back already but I canceled my flight last minute. 

I‚Äôm overwhelmed.

What really breaks me is knowing this didn‚Äôt have to happen. I‚Äôve seen other people with the same health issues fight so hard for treatment ‚Äî they‚Äôd do anything to get access to meds like SCIg. I got approved for it in two weeks. Even when I switched insurance companies. But I quit treatment after the first few doses because I mentally couldn‚Äôt handle it. I went to a support group for other people
like me.. because I thought it‚Äôd make me feel better. But it didn‚Äôt. I was the youngest there and I seemed so much healthier, I felt like I didn‚Äôt belong. They told me I‚Äôd need to switch to taking my injections to every other day instead of weekly and I just‚Ä¶ refused. I hated that the stupid needles had to stay in me for hours. 

I feel like an idiot. A reckless idiot.

Now I‚Äôm looking at real damage. I‚Äôm terrified. I have an autoimmune disease known for attacking organs‚Äîpossibly multiple autoimmune diseases now. I‚Äôm immunocompromised and I‚Äôve been hard relapsing from my ED for months while completely off my meds. I don‚Äôt foresee I‚Äôm going to find out good things about my organs

The worst part? It STILL didn‚Äôt wake me up.

It didn‚Äôt snap me into recovery mode. It made me spiral deeper. My brain went, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm screwed anyways. Might as well be skinny.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt want advice. I think I just wanted to vent somewhere. I‚Äôve been pretending I‚Äôm okay for so long. I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm angry. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm grieving the body I sabotaged. I don‚Äôt know how I allowed myself to do this to me

Entire_Weather3209,1lnyqeg,Anybody else scared to leave ED spaces..?,True,"I want to be very clear I am very pro-recovery though I am not recovered or ready for it any time soon. However- for me, one of the scariest part is actually giving up the ED community. Being in ED spaces feels cozy for me in a weird way- I don‚Äôt feel judged and things of that nature for the most part. I feel like if I ever do recover and leave ED communities I‚Äôm going to spiral anyways because I start feeling isolated and alone. I know that because it‚Äôs what happens every time I try to recover.. I know a lot of the advice is going to be to try to make new friends and things of that nature, to help with the isolation aspect but the thing is that I‚Äôve tried a lot- many times- and it doesn‚Äôt really seem to go well for me which just makes me crash even harder into a relapse. I just don‚Äôt know what to do when it‚Äôs time to recover if I ever do feel ready for it.. it honestly makes me want to cry when I even think about leaving ED communities because I know how alone I‚Äôll feel. I know it‚Äôs sick obviously and again I am super pro-recovery but my ED and ED spaces is what comforts me.. without it mentally it makes me fall apart and I just relapse anyways. 

The only real reason I‚Äôve ever managed to recover in the past and was able to stay recovered was because of being in a romantic relationship, I felt obligated to recover so I did and having a romantic partner made me feel like I wouldn‚Äôt be alone. But, that‚Äôs not really the reason I‚Äôm ‚Äúsupposed to‚Äù recover, also I‚Äôm single now and am refusing romantic relationships because I‚Äôve now realized if anything goes wrong in one, it causes me to crash very hard into a relapse. I don‚Äôt feel safe being in one anymore because I genuinely fear of what it could do to me. A break up is what caused my current relapse and I truly am starting to doubt my ability to recover at this point so ever getting into a romantic relationship again feels dangerous to me.

Entire_Weather3209,1lf2q0m,Extreme pain when I eat,True,"I‚Äôm not looking for medical advice ‚Äî I‚Äôd just like to hear people‚Äôs personal experiences with this, please.

I recently saw a gastroenterologist who said I‚Äôll need to have my appendix removed soon (not emergent, but necessary). I also found out I have an umbilical hernia, which I suspect is from purging. I‚Äôve had gastroparesis for years, and I‚Äôve struggled with bulimia off and on since I was 13 (I‚Äôm 25 now). Just wanted to share that background since it might be relevant.

Now to the actual issue:
Eating is excruciating. It‚Äôs been painful for months, but it‚Äôs getting worse. I just spent the last 12 hours crying off and on because I ate something ‚Äî not even a normal portion ‚Äî and it wrecked me. It was the only thing I ate all day. Liquids are usually better, but not always. Even tiny amounts can hurt. I‚Äôm not trying to recover right now ‚Äî I‚Äôm not ready ‚Äî but I know I still need to eat something during a relapse, and I can‚Äôt even do that without pain. I have to >!purge!< to make the pain stop.

I asked my GI and he said the pain could be permanent, but that I could take painkillers to manage it. That‚Äôs terrifying. I don‚Äôt want to need medication just to eat for the rest of my life.  I am going to get another opinion because maybe I‚Äôm just in denial but I‚Äôm struggling to accept that. Regardless, this is honestly pushing me deeper into the relapse because I keep thinking: if I‚Äôm already ruined, what‚Äôs the point?

If you‚Äôve experienced this- did it get better?
I used to ‚Äúbounce back‚Äù after restriction if I slowly worked my way up ‚Äî liquids to soft food to solid. But I can‚Äôt even do soft food now. It hurts so much. And that‚Äôs making me afraid that I‚Äôve done permanent damage.

I think this is partly because my restriction this time has been so intense. I‚Äôve had failed ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù attempts since my relapse started in September, but even when I was ‚Äútrying,‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt hit >!700!< cal most of the time both because of my ED thoughts but also the physical pain. Most days I was stuck at >!300‚Äì500!< max, and honestly I think I burned off a lot of muscle rather than fat. This is the most extreme restriction I‚Äôve ever sustained, and I think my body is just breaking down. Usually my cals from relapses are much higher and I have lots of binges but this time wasn‚Äôt like that

Has anyone else had unbearable pain when trying to eat, even in small amounts? Is this common with long-term restriction? Is it normal or am I being dramatic? I feel lost. I feel like such a whiner because I didn‚Äôt even end up in the hospital or something so I feel like maybe I‚Äôm just being a wuss and I need to toughen up..I‚Äôm not even skinny this is so frustrating for me. I know that‚Äôs not supposed to matter to me but I mean if I‚Äôm going to be like this.. like at least make me skinny üò≠",https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1lf2q0m/extreme_pain_when_i_eat/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1lf2q0m/extreme_pain_when_i_eat/,EDAnonymous,Entire_Weather3209,1750310510.0,2025-06-19T05:21:50+00:00,2,1.0,2,0,3

Impurest_Vessel,1kxmxcc,Software Update - Bad News!,True,"My store is so far, *allegedly*, the only store to have gotten a software update for the registers and it's going horribly. Not anyone's fault perse but some of the errors we encountered were:

\- me being on register three somehow blocked my boss from going on register two *(another cashier could, just not the manager).*

\- none of the hotkeys worked

\- sometimes ALL the keys would fail

\-  sometimes the touchscreen would stop responding

\- gift card transactions simultaneously failed AND went through? *(Manager looked at the read it says it went through, but on my end* ***(with his supervision)*** *we watched it fail).*

\- all credit/debit returns need the card present, not just debit

\- you can't do employee discount if you use your rewards

\- all the self-serve printers didn't charge, just printed activity slips which also had to be used at the registers.

\- at one-point 3/4 registers in store were dead and the only one working kept wanting to die.

so yeah. that's how our day today was.

Edit to add a few days later:

The gift card transaction ended up needing a return/refund because despite saying it failed, it did charge him 2k. The gift cards to anywhere outside of OD itself still don't work.

How's everyone else feel about the full-service fee though? Think it's fair? Needs a rework? Or are we all just counting the days lol?

  
Extra context: Our minimum means it needs to be $5.00, his 5 mil lamination brought it to $2.68 since he did the printing himself and there were no cuts.

This was a City of Mist campaign, my first personal campaign, and also the last campaign myself and five other people did with this group. This is also my first post, so apologies if anything is weird.

**The cast is:**

Myself: A warforged office worker. *(named Pike)*

Lane: a psychic ghost girl

Naveen: A baker who got turned into a cookie and also a roach. (A different story altogether)

Jafaar: A mean snake demon guy who was annoying most of the time.

Yulong: An axolotl and the secret best boy.

Torgel: A kobold who could more or less control fire.

Cletus: A southern engineer pixie.

Zehn: Frog doctor/scientist who has committed high crimes.

And our DM, playing a great deal of characters, including the Big Bad.

&#x200B;

So, our story begins with us all in a cave, post battle with three young dragons. Two have been killed, and one was tamed. We discover through Zehn's communication with them, that their father had stolen their free will and forced them all to fight us. Jafaar is sleeping.

We agree to bring the two dead ones back to life and split into two groups to do so. Group one is Zehn and Cletus, who are making a *Mecha*. Group two is Naveen and myself, who elect to make him into some sort of *baked construct*. (Think of Mothza Supreme, it's basically that.)

Naveen can create him, but needs to cook him - and Pike runs because of a furnace in his chest. We elect to cook the pizza dragon in my chest. Two turns and a roll later (the same roll was done for the mech team) and both dragons are alive again!

Mech dragon is able to speak and begins talking to Zehn. Pizza dragon emerges from my chest like a feral little thing, kicking and screaming. He cannot speak, so he flies around and throws a temper tantrum because he's confused. 

The mech dragon names itself Trollbringer (after the type of science Zehn and Cletus practice. Troll Science) and Naveen and I settle on naming our pizza dragon Nasturtium. It turns out that is all he can say, and only we can understand his speech. He lands on my shoulders and drips cheese and grease down my character's suit.

Jafaar, after waking up and looking around, finds an exit - and for the sake of time we all follow him without much fuss. We enter a room full of mist and people and see the father of the three dragons standing there, with many people and things around him.

He has obtained the tavern receptionist Tiny Tim *(who is a dragon and very chatty)* an easy bake oven, Jafaar's kidnapped wife, and our alleged paramedic who none of us know. His request is: **give him Yulong and he gives us all our stuff back.** 

Apparently somehow, he can use Yulong to gain immortality, and decide who lives and dies and which species will survive. He will already live longer than the rest of us so why he cares is beyond the party; we all begin to question him because of that exact reason.

After a while of questioning and Lane asking to *""rock paper scissors""* it, he demands to battle. We don't roll for initiative, you just go.

I roll to use a skill which is communicating with tech, to convince the easy bake oven to join us. I roll a great success and it springs to life. Naveen turns into a giant buff cockroach and begins punching it with his electric oven mitts, Torgel blasts him with fire.... etc.

Every roll except for one was a success. The only failed roll was mine. I was attempting to cauterize the dragon father's wing so he couldn't regrow it *(I failed, but it still burnt him.)*

Cletus, acting as Trollbringer, flies up, fires the troll gun *(effectively a small nuke which could have TPK'd us)* and lands a direct hit, controlling the collateral with their points left over to keep the blast on their father. The roll 20 map is decimated. Everyone is drawing on it at this point.

Yulong's player asks the DM to remove the drawings of blood and ectoplasm, so she tries. Instead, what happens is she removes the entire map from beneath us, leaving everyone in the white void. In an attempt to fix this, she adds the map back in, and we all vanish off of it. The drawings can't be removed, they live there now.

She settles on leaving us in the void, but alive.

Naveen rolls to suplex the dragon father as he attempts to heal himself once more - and gets a great success. He does so, and asks to roll again. And he says:

*""Can I roll to mortal kombat him and rip off his head and spine?""*

And the DM says yes.

He rolls.

He gets a 15, more than enough to succeed. As a giant buff cockroach, he grabs the dragon's head and YANKS. There's a scchlk noise, and a pop, and the villain is no more.

This was being built up for two hours, we killed the villain in 15 minutes. Lane's grandmother appeared *(alive, as Lane died young)* and Pike got to adopt a cobblestone clone of himself, an easy bake oven, and a giant dragon made of pizza. Pike has lost his briefcase and his suit is covered in cheese, grease, sauce, blood, and ectoplasm.

Everyone went back to the tavern, Lane's grandmother made dinner, Pike and Zehn got that ice cream Pike promised in a session wherein Zehn's human experiments were discovered... and all was well.

KlausMikaelsonsWife,1iictm5,My friend being insensitive to my dying brother,True,"(Sorry for the unstructured writing) Hello everyone, two days ago my (13) disabled brother was walking home from school when he was hit by a moving car I won't get too much into it because the cops are still investigating but it was a hit and run and my brother ended up with numerous injuries including brain damage and he has been unconscious in the hospital ever since. I am still in denial if you couldn't tell, I have been feeling feelings like I've never felt before, I've been depressed my whole life but this feels different like my whole life has been turned upside down and my life and my parents life will never be the same, as you can imagine we have been getting lots of messages and calls from friends and family wanting to know what happened and we don't have any energy to deal with nosy family members.

When I briefly went home yesterday to get some items like a charger my headphones and some books I decided that I was going to call my best friend and tell her what happened (mind you the only people that we've really talked to were just my grandparents) when she first picks up she sounds very upbeat and she says ""so how's the dead brother"" we've always had a sarcastic dark humor friendship about a lot of stuff but this was just so shocking and I kind of pause before asking her not to make fun of the situation because I don't know if he's going to live or die and she kind of backs off and starts apologizing and saying she didn't mean it and after that we had a pretty good conversation.

Fast forward today I get a call from her sister saying how she heard her sister (my best friend) saying some ""pretty fucked up shit"" about my brother to her family, she was saying how ""getting hit by a car in 2025 is crazy"" and ""I can't believe that (my name) was actuallly sad about it"" as if he isn't my fucking brother. Anyway she was basically just saying stuff like that and being a bitch, which genuinely shocked me to my core because I had confided in her for years about everything that I've had to go through and she's never done anything like this.

I didn't want to believe it so I called my best friend directly and confronted her and I was met with silence literal silence and then when she sighed and I heard her begin to apologize, I hanged up and turned off my phone and I'm indecisive about what to do. I don't want her apologizes or her fake empathy and I certainly don't want to be friends with someone who doesn't even have the decency to not gossip about a child that's in the hospital. But she's also still my best friend and we've been through so much.

The only person I have been in contact with is my grandma and when I told her what happened she told me that my emotions are high right now and that I shouldn't do anything hasty, our families are close and so apparently a lot of my cousins are siding with her and saying that I overreacted and I'm doing too much.

Please give me some advice on what to do.

The only time I ever saw any affection was on the boat in s1 but otherwise nothing. I felt Rose did love Peter but it felt circumstantial and she was just so shitty in s2. I was quite literally shipping them with everyone else, I mean Peter had more chemistry with Noor and Alice then Rose atp and I think their relationship should‚Äôve ended in s1.

(And vice versa.),True,"This is a question that has left me with a lot of mixed emotions because while I felt Daemon did love Laena to a certain extent, she deserved so much better than him. There's no doubt in my mind that Daemon loved his children but I think he used Laena for his own political gain (as is every relationship on the show), -that's not to say he didn't feel anything for her-. Same goes for Laena I think she for sure loved her children and unlike Daemon I believe she tried to have a deeper connection with him but it fell short. I haven't read the books so i cant say much about their relationship on there tho.

I'm kind of preparing for the worst and if the vet thinks its best to put him to sleep I would go with that option as much as it breaks my heart. I can see he is in pain and I just don't want him to suffer. I guess I'm writing this because I want to hear other experiences with large cysts or tumours.

alexisseffy,1lfx4om,19 with chronic/treatment resistant anorexia nervosa and osteoporosis,True,"Recently diagnosed with osteoporosis after getting a DEXA scan done (-2.7 L spine). I have had anorexia since I was 13 and have not been able to recover or stay at a healthy weight even with treatment. I had a period for a bit when I was doing better with eating but haven‚Äôt had one since last September. I know the obvious solution to my problem is to gain weight, but at this point that is not a realistic goal for me and I am looking for other methods of harm reduction I can use to at least prevent things from getting worse. 

My PCP told me to take calcium and vitamin D. The issue with calcium supplements is that they exacerbate my chronic constipation, which makes me unable to eat, which obviously goes downhill really fast and will probably result in another hospitalization. I don‚Äôt tolerate dairy well either and I know it‚Äôs hard to get in enough nutrients with a very restricted diet so I figure supplements are the next best option. Anyone have recommendations for calcium supplements that don‚Äôt cause GI Problems? 

I would do weight bearing exercise, but I am supposed to limit exercise to prevent my weight from dropping even lower. I know my situation is really complex given my anorexia and GI problems, so I will be seeing a gastroenterologist and an endocrinologist soon.

alexisseffy,1ko6l6i,It is so terrible to see parents neglect and/or enable their children with eating disorders,True,"I've noticed an alarming pattern in a certain online ED community where a very young teenager is basically on death's door with severe medical complications, and the parents do not force them into treatment or even enable their ed. 

And of course since this space is an echo chamber or sick teenagers who resent their parents for forced treatment (and I get it - I hated my parents when they forced me into treatment as a teen, and I still have issues with them now as an adult because of it) everybody dogpiles on the parents and doctors for being so ""evil"" and ""abusive"" for forcing the patient to eat or gain weight. Obviously it's not a pleasant situation for anyone and it would be great if they wanted help, but what's the alternative? Letting your child starve to death? IMO, A child, especially in a state of severe malnutrition, does not have the cognitive capacity to make their own treatment decisions. As someone who was forced into treatment, I honestly don't think I would have made it past 15 if my parents let me do my own thing like I wanted. I am still very sick and forced treatment did not cure me (and the way my parents did it made things worse IMO), but at least I am alive and seeking help on my own now.

What's even worse is seeing their parents not want them to get treatment either. Not going to name drop but there's this person whose parents went to court and lost custody over them for not consenting to life-saving ED treatment as recommended by the medical team. Most parents don't want to see their child suffer through forced treatment, but if the alternative was starving to death I think any rational parent would force treatment and not forcing them to go to treatment would be neglect. I understand it‚Äôs not an easy decision, especially since kids will often say ‚ÄúI will never eat/talk to you/I will hurt myself if you force me‚Äù (yeah, I tried all of those trust me I know)

Another example I saw was a parent letting their child with a BMI of >!! 11 !!< drive a car. If I was a parent, there is no way I would let my child in such a compromised state drive a car and endanger themselves and others. It's so terrible to see these kids suffer and the parents either not know how to help or don't want to help. I'm not trying to suggest that forced recovery is always a good option, but when it comes between life and death, something has to be done. I agree that complete psychological recovery cannot be forced, but you won‚Äôt even have a chance at it if you‚Äôre dead ",https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1ko6l6i/it_is_so_terrible_to_see_parents_neglect_andor/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1ko6l6i/it_is_so_terrible_to_see_parents_neglect_andor/,EDAnonymous,alexisseffy,1747416331.0,2025-05-16T17:25:31+00:00,34,0.93,37,3,0

aqua4cry,lt3acm,Myers-Briggs Personality Test Analysis,True,"So recently, I took the Myers Briggs personality test. I took one for my personality, then I switched gears and took one in Takuto's shoes and how the Persona 5 writers would categorise him. 

Turns out, *we're an absolute perfect match.* I'm an INFP (Mediator) and he's and INFJ (Advocate/Counselor - makes perfect sense), the rarest personality type in the world! We both have a compassionate and idealistic nature, and if we disagree on some things, when it comes to the important stuff, we're on the same page. We share a dedication to our ideals and a commitment to helping others. Although we may follow different paths, fundamentally, our goals are the same: to make the world a better place. This shared ethic gives us the opportunity for a deep and lasting bond! He's a lot more tidy than I am, and even though we share a lot of the same values, we're both very stubborn in our ways. Conflict is *extremely rare,* but conflict about morals or our core ideologies can get *explosive really fast.* I'm quicker to apologize and he's already thinking of a solution to our problem >!that doesn't involve him taking away my free will.!< I'm not surprised at the amount of positive chemistry we have, it was love at first sight.

 I'm going to link the Myers Briggs test [here](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) and please tell me your personality type, your S/O's personality type, and how you're supposed to get along romantically according to the types chart l, then how you *actually* get along together. It's going to be super interesting to see the results and super fun for everyone to learn more about their partner. I can't wait to hear about everyone's relationships!

aqua4cry,1hcvgmf,A little worried...,True,"So 2 years ago I was prescribed Olanzepine. When my psychiatrist prescribed it, she told me hunger was just a feeling I'll have to live with, and to mitigate potential weight gain I'd have to exercise. And exercise I did! I was in my best shape ever, I could run for over an hour straight (~5 miles), deadlift 300 pounds, and do situps with 70+ pounds of resistance. Despite doing the One Punch Man workout every day and basically starving at 1400 cals a day, my weight stayed around 175 and my bmi at 28, body fat 27%. When I left home for school, I focused on my studies and less on my health and gained about 30 pounds in a semester and 4% more body fat. That's when my psychiatrist started me on Lybalvi (Olanzepine + Samidorphan). I had such a bad reaction to it we stopped it before week 2; extreme nausea and fatigue. Coming home for the summer I was only able to shake off about 17 pounds when I went back to my old exercise and eating intensity. This semester I gained it all back + about 5 pounds. We started the Tirzepatide compound in October and now I'm at 30 units of 5 mg for the next few weeks but I still have ""food noise"" and cravings, and even with exercise I'm only losing about as much as I would normally, and I'm abnormally tired, just like I was with Lybalvi.

The reason I'm posting this here is I'm worried about being resistant to Tirzepatide. Could it be that I'm not at a high enough dose? My doctor sent a 7.5 mg Rx that I'll be on soon.

She and my sister (also a doctor) were talking and said that staying on the (incorrect) starting dose of 25 units instead of increasing would still benefit me.

cupidhurts,1mdmsek,just a rant i need to get off my chest (tw: suicide mention),True,"i know this counts as emotional neglect but like there‚Äôs still some part of me that‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre overreacting‚Äù because my mother‚Äôs favorite pastime is trying to convince me my trauma isn‚Äôt trauma so. anyways.

i attempted suicide for the first time in 2020. i was miserable and alone and felt like i was a burden on everyone and no one would ever be able to love me. so i attempted, got freaked out, called the paramedics, and went to the hospital.

i was admitted to the hospital then got transferred to the psych ward. first day, maybe 12 hours after i went to the hospital, my mother comes to visit during visiting hours. she sits down. first thing she says to me, before even asking how i‚Äôm feeling? ‚Äúi‚Äôm mad at you‚Äù. i was WAY less confrontational with her then than i am now, and too tired to even think of anything to say back, but if i had one do over in life i would have said ‚Äúwhat the fuck is wrong with you?‚Äù and asked a nurse to kick her out. 

then i bring it up to her years later. she does her usual song and dance of ‚Äúi‚Äôm entitled to my feelings‚Äù (sure, but you‚Äôre not entitled to express them without caring a single bit about how anyone else will feel, ESPECIALLY with what you said in the context it was in??), ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre still upset about that, you need to let go of your anger‚Äù (no i think being pissed that your own mother decided her feelings were more important than yours LESS THAN A FULL DAY AFTER YOUR SUICIDE ATTEMPT is grounds for being pissed actually), and ‚Äúi was going through a lot‚Äù (i quite literally tried to kill myself????? hello????????? forgive me for not really caring about your mental health at the time bc i was trying to die)

again, i know i‚Äôm probably right in my assessment that she was being awful here. but there‚Äôs still a little part of me that‚Äôs like, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs right and i‚Äôm the worst person ever for not caring about how others would feel‚Äù which, ironically, would be the deciding factor in doing it ‚Äúright‚Äù if i ever felt desperately suicidal again.

i just don‚Äôt know what goes through her head. if ANYONE i knew, let alone my own child, attempted, i‚Äôd be heartbroken but put full focus on them. it‚Äôs not about me, it‚Äôs about them. my feelings can take a backseat or be discussed with someone else i know or a therapist. i would DEFINITELY not feel entitled to make it about me in the goddamn psych ward LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER THEY ATTEMPTED.

funkydyke,1lwhhwn,getting nutrients in - a smoothie guide,True,"Smoothies are a fantastic way to sneak nutrients into our ARFID diets. Many different things can be added to smoothies without affecting the taste or texture. This is a versatile guide on how you can make your own, from your fellow ARFID girlie & former juice bar barista. I‚Äôve also included my go-to recipes as examples. I hope this is helpful for y‚Äôall. Lmk if you have questions or need help troubleshooting.

Base recipe
6-8 oz Frozen* fruit 
6-8 fl oz liquid**
1 serving protein source (optional to skip if using milk as liquid)
optional add-ins for other nutrients (fiber, healthy fats, etc.)

Protein sources
Greek yogurt
Kefir
Silken tofu (sounds weird but trust me)
Nut powder/butter (peanut, almond, etc.)
Milk (dairy or some alternatives)
Hemp seeds
Protein powder 

Liquids 
Fruit or veg juice (orange, pineapple, apple, carrot, etc.) 
Milk or alternative milk
Cold brew/coffee
Ensure/boost supplement

Optional add-ins
Flax seeds/oil
chia seeds
Avocado
Spinach (or other greens)
Fiber supplement (psyllium husk)
Electrolyte powder
Oats
Veggies***

Suggested recipe #1 
Frozen banana 
Peanut powder
Cold brew
Chocolate sauce 
Silken tofu 

Suggested recipe #2 
Frozen strawberries
Frozen peaches
Orange juice
Greek yogurt

*I use frozen rather than fresh fruit to avoid having to use ice. Ice will water down the flavors. Whatever fruit you like will work. 

**start with less liquid than you think you need and add more until it‚Äôs blend-able. I usually will add my fruit to the blender first and then add my liquid up to the 3 or 4 cup line on the blender, which is about 6-8 ounces of actual liquid.

garje,xuond4,Grey Area Drinking/Sober Tober,True,"Hi everyone I am new here, and I have loved reading all of your posts. I am definitely a grey area drinker and have wanted to cut back significantly for a while now.  I drink a bottle of wine about 5x a week with two successful AF days.  I am not having luck with cutting back any more than I already have. As I'm drinking before bed, I tell myself tomorrow it will be different, then I wake up and feel hopeful for my goal to quit for 30 days, then 5pm creeps around and I find myself stopping for a bottle of wine, and the cycle continues. The gym is also a big motivator for me, I am very active and I know my wine is quite literally the one thing holding me back from reaching my fitness goals. I know a huge part of drinking for me is habit, and I replace alcohol with a fun drink like seltzer and kombucha in a wine glass on the days I don't drink, and also use herb (although this doesn't do the same for me that alcohol does). I've spent many many years in therapy and am aware of a lot of what my issues are - I am drinking to avoid feeling certain feelings at night: loneliness, boredom, depression. I know Big Alcohol and the media play a huge part in normalizing drinking but how do I stop romanticizing alcohol as a fix for my problems?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/xuond4/grey_area_drinkingsober_tober/,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/xuond4/grey_area_drinkingsober_tober/,stopdrinking,garje,1664815528.0,2022-10-03T16:45:28+00:00,6,1.0,6,0,2

I vividly remember it starting with a dad and a kid, a think a boy who looked to be about 7-8 ish trying to fix a lawnmower in the backyard and the dad is getting really frustrated and gets super aggressive with the lawnmover and the kid flinches back and looks at him scared. The next part I don‚Äôt remember as clearly but there was a woman drinking wine out of a glass and I think it showed that she just did something bad to a baby? The rest of it I can‚Äôt remember at all but I believe there were more little vignettes. I don‚Äôt believe there was any dialogue

I hope this is actually real and not something I experienced in my actual childhood that I gaslit myself into thinking was part of a commercial, but I hope by putting this out there another Aussie millennial might remember seeing it too

icanttkaeitanymore,1m8jr9q,Trying to build a healthier relationship with food while also being a wrestler is AWFUL,True,"I've been struggling with disordered eating since I was 11, I'm 17 now about to go into my senior year and I've been wrestling since my sophomore year. One of the BIGGEST parts of the sport is the weight class system-and on season I perform best at something a lot lower than my regular weight. When I started I had been quasi-recovered for about a year, probably the best relationship I've had with food in a while, and last year I was able to cut down at first without being disordered about it; but then some shitty life events happened and I fully relapsed and started spiraling. And by the time it got to its worst was around districts/regionals and then states, so I had no choice but to stick with the class I had been for most of the season instead of trying to recover because I have to religiously track my intake to maintain that weight.

The thing is, I literally can't perform well at my natural weight range, it's one of the most competitive classes in the sport and I have asthma so it's even worse when I'm around there. And I genuinely can't quit the sport because it's everything to me and the one thing I'm actually passionate about, and on top of that I'm a team captain and one of the best people on the team. Like fuck idk the coaches hail me for being a role model for never missing weight (because I obsess over it non-stop) and the other things I do for the team, but a major facet of the sport is absolutely horrific for my mental health.

Idk I just had to vent about this on here because if I say *anything* about my history and present with disordered eating I won't be allowed to wrestle anymore-which might genuinely be worse for my mental health than dealing with what I do now.

icanttkaeitanymore,1lbbx9z,"update to my post from a few days ago, had an experience that really helped me with loneliness regarding being stealth.",True,"I posted venting about how lonely being stealth was recently because I'd really been struggling with dysphoria and not having anyone to talk to about it, and the other day I hung out with a cis friend I hadn't seen in a really long time. He's got naturally feminine features that he's experienced insecurity over, he's also struggled with a lot of the mental health issues that I have, and we just stayed up talking about life and what it's like to be a man with those types of issues in this world. He doesn't know I'm trans, and he obviously isn't either, but we talked about people asking if you are trans (which he's had happen to him before, multiple times), being treated strangely, etc. 

That experience really helped me get out of the pit I've been in recently about everything, because I've had nobody I could talk to about my issues; at least in the context of real life friends. It helped put into perspective how we're all just people, and that no matter what situation you're in there are people that *will* understand. I hope that hearing this story will help somebody in a similar situation to me as much as it helped me, or at least put into perspective that there's really not as much as a division between what trans and cis people go through as it may seem sometimes.

icanttkaeitanymore,1l7bdu1,"I love being stealth, but god is it damn lonely sometimes.",True,"\*This is going to be all over the place, I just need to get my thoughts out.

I've been on testosterone for 3 years now, I'm 17 and a rising senior; I'm completely stealth to the point that not even my stepdad or anyone besides my *direct* blood relatives and a handful of long-term online friends know. Not even my school administrators because the ones that did know have all left. I have an active social life with some really close friends, and I went to states for wrestling and do cross country, too. I've dated a few girls here and there but never came out to any of them. 

I've always been incredibly dysphoric, especially about my primary sex characteristics, and I'm getting surgery the second it's covered by my insurance (which will be when I turn 18). It's eating me from the inside out, and I can't talk to anyone I'm close with about it because it could put me at risk (I live in a rural area). I feel like there's a wall between me and my close friends because they don't know what is, unfortunately, a massive part of my life. 

And I guess some of my pain about these things will be muted once I've had surgery, but what has really been getting to me is that I haven't met any other transsex guys like me. I've heard from some older stealth guys, which is nice, but I kind of just want a friend my age that understands me if you get what I mean. It feels impossible to find other trans men my age that aren't outwardly feminine, which I don't have a problem with--but I don't *relate to that whatsoeve*r.

2/1/2023: 
I begin a new job and receive select health insurance. I am still covered by my mom‚Äôs BCBS Insurance therefore I am double insured. For some reason, select health gets put as my primary insurance

1/2024:
My prior therapist (who also sees my mom) had mentioned something to my mom about select health denying my claims (I assume because they don‚Äôt cover mental or weren‚Äôt in her network etc) and that she is trying to work this out. 

3/2024:
Therapist sends me a text asking to call both Insurance companies and ask them to update my coordination of benefits. I do this and tell her. She says ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs a waiting game and then we rebill‚Äù 

I hadn‚Äôt heard anything about the claims and my mom who seems to know more about this than me, told me not to worry. 

Today: 
My therapist sends me a text today saying she has spent hours working with the insurance companies and to no avail, therefore I owe her $514.58. She tells me she originally filed with Regence who denied the claims due to double insurance  and the claims sent to Select Health went towards my deductible. She filed an appeal and they denied it. 

I called Select Health today who went over the EOB with me and explained the claims were denied due to the filing period exceeding and that this is a provider fault. Problem is I don‚Äôt know enough about insurance to know if her submitting these late was due to a timing issue on my end or if I really am at fault here.

pessimistic_witch,1j0r190,Won‚Äôt stop barking in crate,True,"I need advice for what to do about my dog barking in her crate. I got my dog in July and the program said she should stay in her crate for 45 min after eating to prevent her stomach from flipping. The issue is she will not stop barking and whining while in there.

They told us to say quiet when she does that but she immediately goes back to barking and whining. They also suggested ignoring her or pet corrector which both haven‚Äôt worked. If she barks I‚Äôm supposed to wait 10min of her being quiet before taking her out but this extends her time in the crate to almost 2 hours.

She is used for my anxiety and when she is barking and whining it makes me super anxious and my heart rate gets really high. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs separation anxiety but I can‚Äôt figure out a way to solve this and the program doesn‚Äôt really respond to my messages. 

Edit: I know she isn‚Äôt alerting my anxiety because she‚Äôs in a separate part of the house and her alert is to paw me, not bark. Also when I take her out she is usually panting a lot and her crate is wet from slobber.

Edit: for everyone saying that I need to sue and that I‚Äôm with a horrible program, I am talking about this one issue. The program has been wonderful otherwise and she is very well trained, this is the only negative experience I‚Äôve had with them.

We recently had a pretty bad winter storm here and the basement of one of his MANY properties had a small pipe burst and water got all over the walls and the walls started to mold. I was asked to go and clean this mess up for him before he brought someone in to repaint the walls and redo the floors which i was kinda pissed about having to do but did it anyways cause he‚Äôs the boss and ‚Äúgotta respect the authority‚Äù.  I was told prior to coming that i didn‚Äôt have to bring any equipment or cleaning supplies because he would have everything i needed so of course being the dumbass i am i took him at his word (BIG MISTAKE!) and of course when i arrived he has nothing i needed. The only supplies given were very loose fitting gloves and two gallons of 12% food grade hydrogen peroxide concentrate which he wanted me to use to clean the walls. This wouldn‚Äôt have been a problem if i was cleaning a room with proper ventilation but i wasn‚Äôt. I was made to clean the moldy walls and floors of the basement which had zero windows, zero ventilation and zero air purifiers or basically anything to negate the peroxide odors. After 4 hours of being in an enclosed basement and breathing in straight peroxide my eyes were burning/red, i couldn‚Äôt stop coughing and hacking up mucus, my head was pounding and my skin was starting to burn. My boss, of course was nowhere to be found as he was gone to another one of his again MANY properties. Finally after the 4 hours and not being able to breathe i went outside to get fresh air and that‚Äôs when the boss came back. He went to check the basement and immediately came back up coughing and complaining about the foul smell of the peroxide. I explained everything that was happening to me and the response was ‚Äúwell then we‚Äôll stop for today and you can come back tomorrow and finish and i‚Äôll see if i can pick you up a mask‚Äù no real concern for my health or current condition.

uselespieceofshi02,1mnk6ie,Anyone elses whole family has a shitty relationship w food?,True,"I mean like all kinds, be it psysical health or mental etc. 

My dad has type 1 diabetes, he has been skinnier than me since I was in middle school and also taller, his bones always visible.

My mum is a secret eater, I remember finding her sneaking junk food into her room from the pantry in the middle of the night from when I was a small kid to now. She also used to use diet pills which she quit because it messed with her mental health. (I wasn't aware of the last part until a few weeks ago.) 

My sister, I don't think she really has a problem with eating but I remember us watching Harry Potter and when I went to use the restroom for a few minutes and when I came back she was just doing butterfly kicks or something and told me she had done like >! 300-400!< and just kept going. (This was when I was attempting to recover so I think you can guess where that went.) so maybe it isn't perfect. (She was also skinnier than me since I was in middle school or so I think.) 

Since elemantry school I have been skipping breakfast sometimes lunch, 1-2 round bread for lunch and only eating when I got home in weekdays. (Which I still ended up fat.) 

My mom would also force me to eat and guilt me or get mad if I didn't as a kid. 

I always felt so ashamed to be compared to my mom because I was fat while my sister was compared to my dad as she was skinny. 

I don't think I had a chance to have a healthy relationship with food like, ever. 

Idk but I hope I get to have a better life next time lol.

The weirdest part is I have been questioning my own gender identity for years and I think I might be under the genderfluid umbrella but I don't like the idea of it either. I used to think of it a lot but it just makesmes extremely uncomfortable to think about so I try not to think about it even tho I go by He/Him or all in online spaces as a girl. 

I've had a similar problem with female characters tho I got over it and I think it was most likely my relationship with women in my life but LGBTQ+ people have never affected me so I don't know why I feel this way.

uselespieceofshi02,1m396wj,Passive suicidal ideation to active suicidal ideation?,True,"I feel like everyone hit rock bottom as of lately, including me. I won't get into detail of my life and rocks it threw at me like im the devil but as long as I can remember I've always had thoughts about being a massive burden and passive suicidal ideation. I didn't understand why my parents kept me alive or took care of me as they never gained anything from me in return and I even became a burden both financially and emotionally. Life always sucked for me but for the past year it wasn't bad, not because I wanted to live but instead suppressed my suicidal thoughts with obsession of food and weight loss which almost made me completely forget of it all. But I gained most of the weight back and can't control myself anymore, and even when I can the thoughts are still there. 

I'm not religious, I started questioning at elementary school. For me it's either nothing or reincarnation and I'm fine with both. 
Lately I've been just yelling and ignoring my family for the most part and suicide doesn't seem that scary anymore. I sit on the window still, sometimes let my leg hang out. I think I would do it if I didn't think and just let it. I know I won't but I think I would if I really wanted to.
This sounds so dumb but I think I'm just living for stupid videos. Like the first thing that comes to my mind thinking about it is ""But I want to keep watching them""
I don't really care about my family or friends as ashamed as I am to admit to this. 

For the past while I've been just thinking of taking the metro and going far away and jumping off a building there and I know I won't do it but it feels more so like a plan ""just in case""

uselespieceofshi02,1lvpddu,I think I resent my family,True,"I hate my dad for always being more interested talking with my sister. I remember crying seeing a photo of them 3 together because not even one of them would even play with me let alone all of them together with me. Since childhood it felt like I walked into a house as a stranger and became the burglar stealing their joy. I always tried to keep silent, I didn't ask for toys or help with homework since seemingly my pure presence was a burden to them. I struggled so much behind clear glass waiting for them to say something yet no one noticed or cared. I stopped taking care of my hyegine, didn't talk in school or in the house for nearly a school year, cut myself for a bit, I had paranoia, suicidal and homocidal thoughts, I fucking stopped eating but none of it seemed to work. My dad isn't the type to get agressive or even yell, only raises his voice but I wished he had hit me instead, I hate how his voice turns back to normal like nothing happened. Maybe if he had hit me there would've been proof of my existence, maybe he would say sorry, maybe he would take me out somewhere as a sorry gift. I lost so much weight and gained it back for nothing. I waited for them to force me into a hospital, I expected our relationship to get better like in movies. 

But it didn't. They didn't call for help. My heart beat would drop under 40 a minute and my thoughts about going to the hospital and a better relationship turned into when and how I would die. It hurt to lay on my bed because I could feel my bones poking. I couldn't breathe. I was like an old women rushing to the bathroom because my pelvic floor muscles were wasting away. I started having heartburns I never had before. I thought when I gained weight we would be closer. 

I wish I fucking let myself die. 

I don't have the balls to slit my throat or jump off a building but starving to death felt like heaven. I didn't feel suicidal anymore, I stopped crying everyday, for once in my life I felt invincible. If I didn't see it bleed, if it didn't hurt as much, if I couldn't see my insides and see how fucked up it all were it meant I wasn't dying.

None of it felt real. 

But I fucking gained the weight back. Nothing changed. I can't even starve like I used to, but when I'm able to I won't stop untill my last breathe. My death will prove how neglectful they were. I hope they won't be able to sleep without guilt. I don't want them to die, I want them to suffer with the consequences. They could've just given me away if it was that hard to acknowledge my existence. I know I would've been happier.

uselespieceofshi02,1lm51e3,The only time I don't feel suicidal is when I restrict,True,"Thats it. What the title says. I can't remember a moment in my life where I didn't worry about my weight or how much I ate. The shame I felt  when I stood next to my sister who's 11 years older than me, because I weighted far more than her probably all my life. The time I realized my own dad that is taller than me and a grown man was skinnier than me. The disgusting looks people gave me because I was fat. The embarrassment I felt because I felt hungry, all those times I let my stomach rumble in the classroom knowing everyone could hear it. At elementary school I hoped I died before 13 because it already felt like too much and I was sure I would go to hell if I attemted suicide after 13.

This school year was probably the best year of my life. I can't remember anything, I was obsessed with fasting and steps and food but for once I was able to look in the mirror and don't want to die. I almost never even thought about suicide the entire time. I actually wore things that I liked, that showed skin. For the first time I didn't feel ashamed for eating too much because I knew I would burn them later anyway. 

I was happy when I looked sick. Nobody had cared about me before when I didn't take showers or didn't talk. I had paranoia, thought humanoid creatures were watching and following me. Thoughts about suicide and homocide were common. Only time anyone said a thing was when I was skinny. I loved parting my hair so they could see my bones from the back, as if to prove I was sick. 

But I gained the weight back, I thought I wanted recovery but I was wrong. I've never been more suicidal.It only now realized that I would rather die young like this than to live like that ever again. I feel bad feeling this way as seeing how this has ruined others life, but it's the only thing that adds a meaning to mine.

Prior to me gaining weight I would religiosly walk and exercise(untill I had to stop due to my bones hurting) and the days that I did eat I would eat very slowly to the point of sitting on the table watching youtube for 2 hours straight. I litterally wouldn't do anything else, as soon as I finished exercising I would sleep, the next day when I did get to eat it took hours and the next day I would take a shower before sleeping. I would litterally only watch youtube while exercising or on the days I ate I was like a living zombie. 
Now that I'm eating I don't know what to do. I don't want to read, write, play games, watch videos or hang out with friends. Sure they are fun but It's like a mental block just stopping me from doing them. I don't go out because I'm too ashamed so I'm stuck at home I'm just eating so the time will pass. I was having breakdowns every other day back then and now too I still have them, probably worse even. I'm scared of my mental health getting worse and I'm already starting to havebadh hygieneanda maybe am becoming paranoid(which has happened before) and I'm terrified I will get bad again.

xoxoAnniMuxoxo,1mk29tm,Bad Apologies Built Up My Resentment Over the Years,True,"I don't really know how to start this off or if I'm using the right flair but let me start with a scenario.

   Let's say Friend A bumped into Friend B and Friend B fell to the ground. It was most likely unintentional and Friend A didn't mean to hurt Friend B yet Friend A isn't quick to apologize. Friend B then goes ""hey you bumped into me and I fell"". Now instead of just apologizing like ""oh I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you"" ""I'm sorry I should've paid attention"", they're going to fluff up their entire apology with an endless amount of words.  
   ""I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention I'm just going through a lot right now. You know this happened and that happened. The other day I was. And then this thing happened so I'm just going through a lot right now. I know that it sounds dumb but that's just what I'm feeling right now. I'm just so frustrated I just""

   So now Friend B feels bad for feeling slighted because the situation is so difficult for Friend A and now being bumped into seems like such a petty thing to be mad at Friend A for so Friend B ""forgives"" Friend A.

   I would be so mad thinking about how my ex-friend never apologized to me but looking back it's not that they didn't apologize it's that I had a hard time accepting their apologies because of stuff like this. It's like every time something happened that they had to apologize for they made themselves so sympathetic that I end up feeling like I'm in the wrong for being upset in the first place.

   Of course, I don't believe they ever did this maliciously but rather they just honestly don't think about their words and action. It still ate me up because I'd rather they just not be apologetic at all instead of saying stuff like how they'll ""make it up"" to me but never do or how no matter how they offend me, it always becomes about me validating, reassuring, comforting them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1mk29tm/bad_apologies_built_up_my_resentment_over_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1mk29tm/bad_apologies_built_up_my_resentment_over_the/,lostafriend,xoxoAnniMuxoxo,1754578527.0,2025-08-07T14:55:27+00:00,9,0.92,10,1,4

xoxoAnniMuxoxo,1hsdcfi,It Was Hard to Feel Bad for Farleigh,True,"I'll start by saying this isn't a hate/anti Farleigh post because I ended up not really hating any of the characters and I sort of liked how unlikable each character was in their own way. Though I do admit I found his character to be the most frustrating and I'm not sure if we were even supposed to root for him. 
The two main defenses I see for Farleigh to act the way he did was that he saw right through Oliver's facade and that he was treated like crap by the Catton family. 
I don't really like the ""he saw right through Oliver"" defense because Farleigh was literally always a bully to him; the second Oliver stepped in Oxford, Farleigh was picking on him for his clothes. Farleigh didn't do anything with this ""I see through you"" angle beyond being an ass to Oliver.
Then the stuff about being victimized by the Catton family I can *try* to see but I just don't see it that way. I saw an older post here that says the movie has a lot of ""tell don't show"" in the writing and the stuff with Farleigh is a huge example of that. In the real world, people like Farleigh often *would* be treated like the outcast of a rich family for being ""American""(now we all know damn well it's not about being American). I watched the movie several times and I just did not see how Farleigh was treated like the outcast. According to Felix, they grew up together and we see that he and Farleigh were really tight both in Oxford and Saltburn so Farleigh was practically one of the siblings. Farleigh seems to be comfortable enough in Saltburn to straight up claim that it's ""his house"". 
The stuff with Farleigh's mom is another example of how we can *try* to feel for him but I just couldn't. Felix and Farleigh were arguing because Sir James denied sending more money to Farleigh's mother. It's implied that his actual home life is troubled but it honestly sounds like the majority of it is his mom's fault yet he acts like it's the Catton family's responsibility. In the big argument between Farleigh and Felix, he claims it's not fair that the parents are throwing this party for Oliver when his mom is living in squalor, and when Felix says it's not true Farleigh says ""at the rate that she's going, she's going to be"". 
So why is that on Sir James and not herself or Farleigh's father? Considering the last name, it sounds like she married Farleigh's father so they should have the means to be living a normal life yet Farleigh acts like it's Sir James that's the problem. Ok, we can argue that the it's an issue that Sir James inherited the money so it's fair that he consistently supports any of his siblings and their families. What we know of Farleigh's mother was that she was able to at least attend Oxford so that she could get herself an education and a career of her own yet she chose to run away from home to America. Sir James did try to support her but she would consistently lose the money yet he was still willing to support Farleigh and let him stay at Saltburn and away from his problems at home and support his education at Oxford to get his life together.WHY would Sir James do all this for Farleigh if he doesn't care about him or see him as family? I wouldn't be surprised if for whatever reason the parents are a certain way with Farleigh is not because he's ""American"" but really because Sir James just doesn't want much to do with his sister, but Farleigh being the innocent child in all this, they're willing to keep Farleigh out of trouble. Both Catton siblings say that their parents have no problem giving Farleigh whatever he asks for and he doesn't even deny that, he has a problem with having to ask at all.
Anytime there's moments we can try to be on Farleigh's side, I just find him too entitled and ungrateful.
What do you think? Anyone has a different angle on this take or aspect of the movie?

Sadly this year I just couldn't help but see Pierre a little differently and I don't know what to make of it. In the beginning of the year, it seemed like he was super happy and had a breakthrough with his career and was consistently posting and I was happy for him even though I found the constant talk of ""manifestation"" ""universe energy"" talk jarring. Then he stops posting content and I just assumed it'd be because he was busy with his whole Japan tour, but the first video he makes when he's ""back"" is a whole misery and doom video. I totally understand that people are human and have good and bad times but I just thought Pierre sort of had his stuff together by now. Obviously, he's totally valid in the stuff he says about not being obligated to post all the time and it shouldn't reflect on his character but at the same time it gets repetitive when he leaves and comes back to say the stuff he says every time he comes back. 

Now with his new video about ""Escaping Your Country"" he's just rambling about the Japan tour, making money, and being totally erratic. I couldn't help but be annoyed that he won't stop talking about how people online hate him for being a man wearing makeup when I feel like by NOW that can not possibly be the only thing people have against him. 

Is he having a serious mental breakdown or is he just putting on a show so viewers feel bad for criticizing him or what?

xoxoAnniMuxoxo,1g1fc8b,Fed Up with Friend's Weight Problem,True,"Content Warning/Trigger warning: 
Weight talk, body talk, diet talk, in case anyone's sensitive about that

Let me start by saying I have nothing against bigger people. In fact I love bigger people that own up to being big as hell and own up to eating like they're pregnant with twins. I myself know I'm not the healthiest person around and my metabolism is giving me a few more years before I need to get it together. What drives me up the wall though are people who COMPLAIN about being fat or being unable to lose weight when they're not doing anything about it. It's like I've been surrounded by this for a while now from different people but the last time I hung out with my friend just made me realize how much this annoys me. 
I feel crappy because I've known them since freshman highschool year and they're one of the nicest people around but this has always been an issue since I've known them. 
They've always been insecure about their weight and I think I asked them before when we were 14 if they were born that way or if they got that way and they insisted they were born that way.I dropped it and fast forward to senior year and I don't know how the topic came up again but I guess they started to explain further that they blamed their weight on having to take steroids as a child. 
It totally made sense to me back then until I saw their whole family and their entire family is big as shit. Obviously, I shouldn't care but even back then I just thought things weren't adding up but I never tried to invalidate what they said on the matter. 
Covid time comes around and we were talking and they said something about the whole mask thing and they said how now despite the masks everyone had to wear, people could still recognize them by their eyes.
I am being cruel here but this comment irked me because it's like no way they recognize you because of your eyes alone. 
Years pass and it's like these last few times we've been hanging out they couldn't stop bringing up their weight. One time they made a whole song and dance about chocolate accidentally touching their lips and how they've actually been trying to diet and I and another friend tried to reassure them that it's ok as long as they've been trying to make the effort into changing. Then the next time we hung out(we almost never hang out these moments span out from like a year from each other in case I had to clarify that)and they kept pointing out outfits on display/sale and mentioning how they'd be nice if they could actually fit in them and I didn't know what to say to re-assure them. 
Last time we hung out I was just out of patience with the weight talk. They had to look for an outfit and I was trying to help them look for one and they kept mentioning how they went up a couple sizes and how they missed being their older size. 
That was over with and before we went back to do the other thing we were going to do, I noticed they went ahead and got some candy and it pissed me off so much. 
We ate earlier and they ordered sweet food, since it was their birthday they were going to have cake and ice cream later, yet they still went ahead and grabbed some candy to eat after all that complaining about going up more sizes.
There have been other stuff about them that irks me but it's like the weight problem is the forefront of them because it's like the peak example to their overall issues that continue to go unaddressed. I don't know I guess it's not really about the weight but rather I'm frustrated that my friend can't get real and maybe it's because as great of a family unit they are lucky to have, they can be a bit enabling, and me myself trying not to hurt their feelings but I just end up being fake and secretly finding all this so annoying but at the same time they're a billion percent an adult and need to take accountability for themselves.

xoxoAnniMuxoxo,1fs4cxm,Is Moving Too Many Banks Bad for Career? ,True,"I feel like I've been using this sub as some kind of work diary for all my work related issues. At the beginning of this year the branch I worked at for Stage Coach shut down and I thought I was going to be able to land an IT job fresh out of graduation which didn't happen. Two months looking for work I ended up finding a job working as some kind of teller/call center person for this tiny Credit Union, which ended up sucking so much but that can be a whole other post in it of itself. Now I got lucky and managed to find a new job while I was still working for the credit union and so right now I'm a part time Universal Banker for the Color Purple(not sure what's the nickname this sub uses for this bank lol).

xoxoAnniMuxoxo,1cj5hmm,New Sleeping Pattern and I've Gotten a Horrible Dream About My Dog,True,"About a month ago, I started a new job and I've been getting into the habit of sleeping a little early at about 9 to 10, wake up after two hours of sleeping, then go back to sleep until morning at about 6. Several times that first bout of sleep is deep enough that I'd have a dream but then when I have the second round of sleep that tends to be either dreamless or dreams I can't even remember.

Often these dreams tend to be more on the stressful end but in a normal way like dreaming of work. Last night I had an extremely distressing dream about my dog.  It was a day everyone was out and screwing around with cars and I realized our dog went missing. It didn't last long and our dog sort of just came back and we were super relieved and she didn't seem the least bit upset about the whole thing. We literally just got her back and we went home and everyone went off to their own rooms in the house, leaving me and the dog in the living room. I was holding her and I dropped her and it immediately killed her. It was like when I dropped my dog, she turned into some material that shattered on impact. After she shattered, the pieces started to shrink and shriveled up like dried fruit. I was on my knees and just screamed like I never had in my real life and when everyone came over to see what's going on they all started just shrieking and wailing.

I could not have been happier to wake up at 12 and went back to sleep without anymore dreams. I can't even begin to come up with what this could've possibly been about. If this explains anything, I had anxieties about my dog being old for years already and I always worry about my parents being careless with the dog like leaving human food where she can reach or not noticing if she's not feeling well. My dog's not having any problems now so I don't know why I'd have this dream, especially why I'd dream about me killing my own dog.

Another thing if it helps make sense of this dream is that this job is my first full time job which means I spend way less time at home, and that makes me way less available for doing stuff at home like taking care of our pets, cooking, cleaning, and my own self-care at a comfortable pace.

Of course, I was still excited thinking the fast responses meant I had it in the bag. The e-mail confirming the details of the interview gave me some information like being early at least ten to fifteen minutes prior to the time and that the interview will be about an hour long. I showed up early as stated, just to still end up waiting for them to be ready by like a few minutes after the appointment time. Not the biggest deal ever but this did happen in like two different interviews before this for other jobs and it did start to grind my petty gears. The interview that stated was going to be an hour long only ended up being wrapped up to 19 minutes long. Their questions didn't seem like they were directed at me and my work history but more like about the bank I worked for previously; kind of like instead of ""oh so did you do this and that?"" it was more like ""ok so did the stage coach do this and that and what do you know about the big scandal of stage coach?"". I was also asked about pay even though I already said I was willing to work for 15 on the application, the virtual interview stayed that job was like 17 and I was content with the rate, yet they still asked me what stagecoach used to pay me. Keep in mind that I didn't tell them ""Oh I already said this and that though"" this was more like something I'm thinking to myself internally. I just went with my initial start pay from stagecoach which was lower than what this bank is offering me so hopefully that won't be an issue.They did say at the start of the interview that they were going to ask questions in Spanish to test my Spanish and they ended up not doing that and honestly I didn't bother to remind them.I don't know how to feel about this interview because it sort of seemed like they weren't interested at all and were waiting for the interview to be done with before the interview even started.

xoxoAnniMuxoxo,1ae2jj6,Customer Pet Peeve Edition One: Customer Press Confirm and Then Said I Made a Mistake,True,"My branch closed last week and I wanna enjoy a break before looking for a new job but it's like I can't stop thinking about my time as a teller for the Horsey Bank(not sure if this sub already made a nickname for the bank I'm talking about so I'm going with Horsey Bank). 

One of the things that made me instantly want to rip my hair out is when I'm asking a customer over and over about what they're trying to do and they say yes and I'll have them confirm on the pin pad what they're doing they press confirm and when it's all over with they freak out that it's not what they're trying to do. Hell, an even more frustrating reaction is instead of just telling me something's wrong, I'll hand them the receipt and they just stare at me and wait for me to ask what's the matter before telling me what's the matter. 

This is especially frustrating when it's a cashier's check and they literally have the chance to look at the information that will be printed on the check and they hit confirm only to come back ready to complain that I made a mistake. 

If the manager is around then I have to be the one coached about communicating effectively and paying attention when that's what I've been trying to do. 

I get if the customers had a long day and they're tired or they honestly just misunderstood but they hardly ever say that they just wanted me to be some kind of witch and just read their mind and manifest whatever they came to the bank for.

I actually like the feeling of snugness on my back and the way it defines my waist and the way I almost feel ""protected"" by the corset so I'm wondering if there's some kind of ""first time anxiety"" to corseting instead of the corset being too small for me.

Or is it possible that the corset is my size but my body just can't reduce itself past 22 inches?

I would wear something like a frilly black shirt but I would wear it with a pair of jeans or tight slacks and some dainty slippers. Some friends did refer to my fit as lolita but I don't think that's accurate. I'd wear something that's not black or gothic looking but suit it with more black or gothic accessories to give it that touch. Basically I don't have any clothes that you can't find at an inexpensive department store but I try to make it a look. 

If I'm not Lolita what do you think my style is? Is there even a term to describe a down played and mundane spin on Lolita?

After a year of eyeballing the Tabu by Dana at the Wal-mart I caved and bought it. I have the worst anxiety of regret purchasing so I regretted buying the perfume the second it scanned at the register but I didn't want to turn back lol

Happy news is that I stopped regretting my purchase the second I actually smelled it! It's such a beautiful scent; it's sweet, warm, spicy, smoky, and charming. It's just the ""cologne"" variant but it's strong enough that I only need one spray for hours too so it'll last a while. I'm definitely going to hit pan on this bottle and get a refill when I'm done. I heard it's got a bad rep because it's supposedly made for prostitutes but I don't care; if I smell like a Spanish Lady of the Night in the 30s I'm gonna be smelling like a Spanish Lady of the Night in the 30s!

xoxoAnniMuxoxo,mqekl1,Best Sources to learn about Romani?,True,"Hello I'm not a roma but I've always been fascinated with it's culture and history but it seems so hard to find sources that give accurate information. It doesn't help that when I want to watch videos on Youtube it seems like they're plagued with comments about how the videos aren't good representation and how the people are worse than they seem and just unnecessary hate. I also live in the United States in South Florida so I never had the chance to really encounter someone from the Romani community. What books, documentaries, websites do you think gives it's viewers the best information to learn about the people?",https://www.reddit.com/r/romani/comments/mqekl1/best_sources_to_learn_about_romani/,https://www.reddit.com/r/romani/comments/mqekl1/best_sources_to_learn_about_romani/,romani,xoxoAnniMuxoxo,1618357579.0,2021-04-13T23:46:19+00:00,10,0.92,11,1,6

xoxoAnniMuxoxo,mg0pn5,Hippies Are Creepier Than Goth/Metal/Punks/Emo/Scenes,True,"I was born in 1999 so I was growing up in the time when the idea of people who are into the G.M.P.E.S crowd were seen as weird suddenly transitioned to them being the cool ones. So I personally didn't grow up in the time where the ""gmpes"" kids were bullied or anything but I heard it was common back in the day. Honestly I grew to find that the hippie subculture is way creepier than the blatantly dark and edgy subcultures.

Like you always imagined them to be the kindest most loving and passive people with their soft comfy clothes and flowers and anti-war sentiment but the 60s and 70s were totally messed up. Behind the koombaya image I just hear about hard core drug use and cult stuff. THAT'S wild

xoxoAnniMuxoxo,m7wwna,Do Pets have a specific relationship term like Human relatives do?,True,"I mean my family has a dog and a cat. I really really **hate** calling the dog my baby or being referred to as her mom; I'd rather just be referred to as the owner to the dog because she's mainly my responsibility. Meanwhile the cat is mainly my sister's responsibility though she doesn't mind the whole ""furmom/furbaby"" thing. Would the pets be referred to as ""siblings""/""cousins"" or just companions?
